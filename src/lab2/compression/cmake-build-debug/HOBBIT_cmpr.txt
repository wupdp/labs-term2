In et reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of Bp noted by readers, ." 2 
corrected. For example, 19 text on pages down 18 are m corresponds exactly !" 19

II first gave to 14 friends, 18 actually set 32 in 14 diary. This departure a.

A final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of 19 lore of 19

"Very pretty!" 1? Gandalf. "But I ." no (a to blow smoke-rings et morning. I am

«I should think so - in these parts! We 62 plain quiet folk 18 ." no use hi

After a while he stepped up, 18 !" 19 spike of 14 staff scratched a queer sign on 19

He rushed 18 put on 19 kettle, 18 put An another cup 18 saucer 18 an extra cake

"I am so sorry to keep 11 waiting!" he -1 going to say, 7 he saw 15 it -1 12 
Gandalf at all. It -1 a dwarf !" a blue beard tucked 8 a golden belt, 18 5 bright 
eyes under 14 dark-green hood. As soon a 19 door -1 opened, he pushed inside, just 
as if he 16 2 expected. 
He hung 14 hooded cloak on 19 nearest peg, 18 "Dwalin at 1. service!" he 1? !" 
a low bow. 
"Bilbo Baggins at yours!" 1? 19 hobbit, too surprised to ask Ya questions hi 19

"Excuse me!" 1? 19 hobbit, 18 off he "a to 19 door. 
"So 11 ." . here at last!" -1 3 he -1 going to say to Gandalf et time. (I it

as if he 16 2 invited. 
"I I, 17 ." begun to arrive already," he 1? 7 he caught sight of Dwalin's

however painful-he might ." to go without. 
"Come along in, 18 ." B tea!" he managed to say Is taking a deep breath. 
"A Do beer ' suit me better, if it is 10 19 same to you, my "O sir," 1? Balin !" 
19 white beard. "But I don't mind B cake-seedcake, if 11 ." any." 
"Lots!" II found himself answering, to 14 own surprise; 18 he found himself scuttling 
off, too, to 19 cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, 18 to 19 pantry to fetch two beautiful round 
seed-cakes Be he 16 baked 15 afternoon hi 14 after-supper morsel.

each of Bp carried a bag of tools 18 a spade. 
In 17 hopped, as soon as 19 door began to open-Bilbo -1 hardly surprised at all. 
"What can I do hi you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at 1. service!" 1? 19 one. "And 
Fili!" added 19 other; 18 17 both swept off er blue hoods 18 bowed. 
"At yours 18 1. family's!" replied Bilbo, remembering 14 manners et time. 
"Dwalin 18 Balin here already, I see," 1? Kili. "Let us join 19 throng!" 
"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't 4 19 sound of that. I really must sit 32 hi a

he 9 12 understand, 18 9 12 want to, hi 17 sounded much too adventurouswhen, ding-dong-aling-' dang, 14 bell rang again, as if B naughty Do hobbit-boy 
-1 trying to pull 19 handle off. "Someone at 19 door!" he said, blinking. "Some four, I 
should say by 19 sound," 1? Fili. "Be-sides, we saw Bp coming along behind us in 
19 distance." 
), poor Do hobbit sat 32 in 19 hall 18 put 14 head in 14 hands, 18 wondered

supper. Then 19 bell rang again louder Or ever, 18 he 16 to run to 19 door. It -1 
12 four Is all, it -1 FIVE. 
Another dwarf 16 H along while he -1 wondering in 19 hall. He 16 hardly turned 
19 knob, be-x)re 17 13 10 inside, bowing 18 saying "at 1. service" ; Is 
another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, 18 Gloin 13 er names; 18 5 soon two purple 
hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, 18 a white hood 13 hanging on 19 pegs, 18 off 
17 marched !" er broad hands stuck in er gold 18 silver belts to join 19 others. 
Already it 16 almost become a throng. Some called hi ale, 18 B hi porter, 18 
; hi coffee, 18 10 of Bp hi cakes; so 19 hobbit -1 kept 5 busy hi a while. 
A big jug of coffee bad just 2 set in 19 hearth, 19 seed-cakes 13 gone, 18 19 
s 13 starting on a round of buttered scones, 7 Lo came-a loud knock. 
Not a ring, H^ a hard rat-tat on 19 hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody -1 
banging !" a stick! 
II rushed along 19 passage, 5 angry, 18 altogether bewildered 18 bewutheredthis -1 19 most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open 19 door 
!" a jerk, 18 17 10 fell in, ; on top of 19 other. More dwarves, four more! And 
Lo -1 Gandalf behind, leaning on 14 staff 18 laughing. He 16 made quite a dent 
on 19 beautiful door; he 16 also, by 19 way, knocked An 19 secret mark 15 he 16 
put Lo 19 morning before. 
"Carefully! Carefully!" he said. "It is 12 4 you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on 19 
mat, 18 then open 19 door 4 a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, 18 
especially Thorin!" 
"At 1. service!" 1? Bifur, Bofur, 18 Bombur standing in a row. Then 17 hung up 
two yellow hoods 18 a pale green one; 18 also a sky-blue ; !" a -" silver 
tassel. This O! belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other Or 
19 T Up Oakenshield himself, who -1 12 at 10 pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's 
mat !" Bifur, Bofur, 18 Bombur on top of him. For ; thing Bombur -1 immensely 
fat 18 heavy. 
Up indeed -1 5 haughty, 18 1? nothing o' service; H^ poor Mr. Baggins 
1? he -1 sorry so many times, 15 at O! he grunted "pray don't mention it," 18 
stopped frowning. 
"Now we 62 10 here!" 1? Gandalf, looking at 19 row of thirteen hoods-the best 
detachable party hoods-and 14 own hat hanging on 19 pegs. 
"Quite a merry gathering! 
I hope Lo is something left hi 19 late-comers to eat 18 drink! 
What's that? Tea! No thank you! A Do red wine, I think, hi me." "And hi me," 1? 
Thorin. "And raspberry jam 18 apple-tart," 1? Bifur. "And mincepies 18 cheese," 1? 
Bofur. "And pork-pie 18 salad," 1? Bombur. "And & cakes-and ale-and coffee, if 
11 don't mind," called 19 other s through 19 door. 
"Put on a few eggs, there's a "O fellow!" Gandalf called Is him, as 19 hobbit 
stumped off to 19 pantries. "And just bring An 19 cold chicken 18 pickles!" 
"Seems to know as much o' 19 inside of my larders as I do myself!" thought Mr. 
Baggins, who -1 feeling positively flummoxed, 18 -1 beginning to wonder whether a 
most wretched adventure 16 12 H right 8 14 house. 
By 19 (a he 16 . 10 19 bottles 18 dishes 18 knives 18 forks 18 glasses 18

19 face, 18 annoyed. 
"Confusticate 18 bebother these dwarves!" he 1? aloud. "Why don't 17 H 18 
lend a hand?" there 18 behold! Lo stood Balin 18 Dwalin at 19 door of 19 kitchen, 
18 Fili 18 Kili behind them, 18 My he -a say knife 17 16 whisked 19 trays 
18 a couple of small tables 8 19 parlour 18 set An everything afresh. 
Gandalf sat at 19 head of 19 party !" 19 thirteen, s 10 round: 18 II sat on 
a stool at 19 fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite -1 quite taken away), 18 trying 
to look as if et -1 10 perfectly ordinary and. 12 in 19 least an adventure. ), 
s ate 18 ate, 18 talked 18 talked, 18 (a . on. At O! 17 pushed er 
chairs back, 18 II made a move to collect 19 plates 18 glasses. 
"I suppose 11 E 10 stay to supper?" he 1? in 14 politest unpressing tones. "Of 
course!" 1? Thorin. "And after. We shan't get through 19 business till late, 18 we 
must ." B music first. Now to clear up!" 
Thereupon 19 twelve dwarves-not Thorin, he -1 too important, 18 stayed talking to 
Gandalf-jumped to er feet 18 made tall piles of 10 19 things. 
Off 17 went, 12 waiting hi trays, balancing columns of plates, each !" a bottle on 
19 top, !" ; hand, while 19 hobbit ran Is Bp almost squeaking !" fright: 
"please be careful!" 18 "please, don't trouble! I can manage." (I 19 s Go 
started to sing:

As 17 sang 19 hobbit felt 19 love of beautiful things made by hands 18 by cunning 
18 by magic moving through him, a fierce 18 jealous love, 19 desire of 19 hearts of 
dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, 18 he wished to go 18 I, 19 
T mountains, 18 hear 19 pine-trees 18 19 waterfalls, 18 explore 19 caves, 18 
wear a sword instead of a walkingstick. 
He looked An of 19 window. ), stars 13 An in a dark sky above 19 trees. He 
thought of 19 jewels of 19 s shining in dark caverns. 
Suddenly in 19 wood beyond ), Water a flame leapt up--probably somebody lighting a 
wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on 14 quiet Hill 18 kindling it 10 
to flames. He shuddered; 18 5 quickly he -1 plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, UnderHill, again. 
He . up trembling. He 16 less Or half a mind to fetch 19 lamp, 18 & Or half 
a mind to pretend to, 18 go 18 hide behind 19 beer barrels in 19 cellar, 18 12 H 
An again until 10 19 s 16 gone away. 
Suddenly he found 15 19 music 18 19 singing 16 stopped, 18 17 13 10 looking 
at -- !" eyes shining in 19 dark. 
"Where 62 11 going?" 1? Thorin, in a tone 15 seemed to show 15 he 
guessed both halves of 19 hobbit's mind. 
"What o' a Do light?" 1? II apologetically. 
"We 4 19 dark," 1? 19 dwarves. "Dark hi dark business! : 62 many hours 
My dawn." 
"Of course!" 1? Bilbo, 18 sat 32 in a hurry. He missed 19 stool 18 sat in 19 
fender, knocking " 19 poker 18 shovel !" a crash. 
"Hush!" 1? Gandalf. "Let Up speak!" And et is bow Up began. 
"Gandalf, s 18 Mr. Baggins! We 62 12 together in 19 house of our friend 18 
fellow conspirator, et most excellent 18 audacious hobbitmay 19 hair on 14 toes

remark a. 19 hob-bit, H^ 19 compliments 13 quite lost on-poor II Baggins, who 
-1 wagging 14 mouth in protest at being called audacious 18 worst of 10 fellow 
conspirator, though no noise 1 out, he -1 so flummoxed. So Up "a on: 
"We 62 met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy 18 devices. We shall soon

estimable Mr. Baggins, 18 perhaps to ; or two of 19 younger s But think I 
should be right in naming Kili 18 Fili, hi instance), 19 exact situation at 19 moment

This -1 Thorin's style. He -1 an important dwarf. If he 16 2 allowed, he ' 
probably ." gone on 4 et until he -1 An of breath, without telling Ya ; Lo 
'anything 15 -1 12 known already. (I he -1 rudely interrupted. Poor II couldn't 
bear it Ya longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, 18 
5 soon it burst An 4 19 whistle of an engine coming An of a tunnel. All 19 
s sprang them knocking " 19 table. Gandalf struck a blue light on 19 end of 14 
magic staff, 18 in its firework glare 19 poor Do hobbit -a be seen kneeling on 19 
hearth-rug, shaking 4 a jelly 15 -1 melting. Then he fell flat on 19 floor, 18 kept on 
calling An "struck by lightning, struck by lightning!" " 18 " again; 18 15 -1 10 
17 -a get An of -- hi a -" time. So 17 took -- 18 laid -- An of 19 way on

business. 
"Excitable Do fellow," 1? Gandalf, as 17 sat 32 again. "Gets funny queer fits, H^ 
he is ; of 19 best, ; of 19 best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch." 
If 11 ." ever seen a dragon in a pinch, 11 E realise 15 et -1 Go poetical 
exaggeration applied to Ya hobbit, Of to Old Took's greatgranduncle 
Bullroarer, who -1 so huge (for a hobbit) 15 he -a ride a horse. He charged 19 
ranks of 19 goblins of Mount Gram in 19 Battle of 19 Green Fields, 18 knocked er 
king Gol-firnbul's head clean off !" a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through 
19 air 18 "a 32 a rabbit hole, 18 in et way 19 battle -1 won 18 19 game of 
Golf invented at 19 same moment. 
In 19 meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant -1 reviving in 19 drawingroom. After a while 18 a drink he crept nervously to 19 door of 19 parlour. This is 3 
he heard, Gloin speaking: "Humph!" (or B snort & or less 4 that). "Will he do, 
do 11 think? It is 10 5 well hi Gandalf to talk o' et hobbit being fierce, H^ ;

Then Mr. Baggins turned 19 handle 18 "a in. ), Took side 16 won. He suddenly 
felt he ' go without bed 18 breakfast to be thought fierce. As hi Do fellow 
bobbing on 19 mat it almost made -- really fierce. Many a (a afterwards 19 Baggins

walked right in 18 put 1. foot in it." 
"Pardon me," he said, "if I ." overheard words 15 11 13 saying. I don't pretend to 
understand 3 11 62 talking about, or 1. reference to burglars, H^ I think I am 
right in believing" (this is 3 he called being on 14 dignity) "that 11 think I am no

Gandalf told us 15 Lo -1 a man of 19 sort in these parts looking hi a Job at once,

"Of course Lo is a mark," 1? Gandalf. "I put it Lo myself. For 5 "O reasons.

He scowled so angrily at Gloin 15 19 dwarf huddled ye in 14 chair; 18 7 II

Gandalf. "Let's ." no & argument.

On 19 table in 19 light of a big lamp !" a red shad he spread a piece 
of parchment rather 4 a map. 
"This -1 made by Thror, 1. grandfather, Thorin, he 1? in answer to 19 dwarves' 
excited questions. "It is a plan of 19 Mountain." 
"I don't I, 15 et E help us much," 1? Up disappointedly Is a glance. "I 
remember 19 Mountain well enough 18 19 lands o' it. 
And I know where Mirkwood is, 18 19 Withered Heath where 19 T dragons bred." 
"There is a dragon marked in red on 19 Mountain, 1? Balin, "but it E be easy enough 
to find -- without that, if ever we arrive there." 
"There is ; point 15 11 haven't noticed," 1? 19 wizard, "and 15 is 19 secret 
entrance. You I, 15 rune on 19 West side, 18 19 hand pointing to it a. 19 other 
runes? That marks a hidden passage to 19 Lower Halls. 
"It may ." 2 secret once," 1? Thorin, "but how do we know 15 it is secret Ya 
longer? Old Smaug 16 lived Lo -" enough m to find An anything Lo is to 
know o' those caves." 
"He may-but he can't ." used it hi years 18 years. "Why?" 
"Because it is too small. 'Five feet high 19 door 18 three may walk abreast' say 19 
runes, H^ Smaug -a 12 creep 8 a hole 15 size, 12 Of 7 he -1 a young 
dragon, certainly 12 Is devouring so many of 19 s 18 men of Dale." 
"It seems a T big hole to me," squeaked II (who 16 no experience of dragons 
18 Go of hobbit-holes) He -1 getting excited 18 interested again, so 15 he forgot 
to keep 14 mouth shut. He loved maps, 18 in 14 hall Lo hung a large ; of 19 
Country Round !" 10 14 favourite walks marked on it in red ink. "How -a such a 
large door be kept secret a. everybody outside, apart a. 19 dragon?" he asked. He 
-1 Go a Do hobbit 11 must remember. 
"In lots of ways," 1? Gandalf. "But in 3 way et ; has 2 hidden we don't know 
without going to see. From 3 it says on 19 map I should guess Lo is a closed door 
Be has 2 made to look exactly 4 19 side of 19 Mountain. That is 19 usual 
dwarves' method- I think 15 is right, isn't it?" "Quite right," 1? Thorin. 
"Also," "a on Gandalf, "I forgot to mention 15 !" 19 map "a a key, a small 18 
curious key. Here it is!" he said, 18 handed to Up a key !" a -" barrel 18 
intricate wards, made of silver. "Keep it safe!" 
"Indeed I will," 1? Thorin, 18 he fastened it upon a fine chain 15 hung o' 14 neck 
18 under 14 jacket. "Now things begin to look & hopeful. This news alters Bp 
much for-the better. So Oh we ." 16 no clear idea 3 to do. We thought of going 
East, as quiet 18 careful as we could, as Oh as 19 Long Lake. After 15 19 trouble 
' begin." 
"A -" (a My that, if I know anything o' 19 loads East," interrupted Gandalf. 
"We might go a. Lo up along 19 River Running," "a on Up taking no notice, 
"and so to 19 ruins of Dale-the old town in 19 valley there, under 19 shadow of 19 
Mountain. (I we none of us liked 19 idea of 19 Front Gate. ), river runs right An of it 
through 19 T cliff at 19 South of 19 Mountain, 18 An of it comes 19 dragon toofar too often, unless he has changed." 
"That ' be no good," 1? 19 wizard, "not without a mighty Warrior, Of a Hero. I 
tried to find one; H^ warriors 62 busy fighting ; another in distant lands, 18 in et 
neighbourhood heroes 62 scarce, or simply lot to be found. Swords in these parts 62 
mostly blunt, 18 axes 62 used hi trees, 18 shields as cradles or dish-covers; 18 
dragons 62 comfortably faroff (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on 
burglary-especially 7 I remembered 19 existence of a Side-door. And here is our 
Do II Baggins, 19 burglar, 19 chosen 18 selected burglar. So m let's get on 18 
make B plans." 
"Very well then," 1? Thorin, "supposing 19 burglar-expert gives us B ideas or

"First I should 4 to know a bit & o' things," 1? he, feeling 10 confused 18 a

"Bless me!" 1? Thorin, "haven't 11 . a map? 18 didn't 11 hear our song? 18 
haven't we 2 talking o' 10 et hi hours?" 
"All 19 same, I should 4 it 10 plain 18 clear," 1? he obstinately, putting on 14

doing 14 best to appear wise 18 prudent 18 professional 18 live up to Gandalf's 
recommendation. "Also I should 4 to know o' risks, out-of-pocket expenses, (a

Kings used to send hi our smiths, 18 reward Of 19 least skilful most richly. Fathers

Indeed he -1 really relieved Is 10 to think 15 17 16 10 gone without him, 18 
without bothering to wake -- up ("but !" never a thankyou" he thought); 18 yet in a 
way he -a 12 help feeling just a trifle disappointed. ), feeling surprised him. 
"Don't be a fool, II Baggins!" he 1? to himself, "thinking of dragons 18 10 15 
outlandish nonsense at 1. age!" So be put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, 18 
washed up. Then he 16 a nice Do breakfast in 19 kitchen My turning An 19

warm spring breeze. II began to whistle loudly 18 to forget o' 19 night before. In 
fact he -1 just sitting 32 to a nice Do second breakfast in 19 dining-room by 19 
open window, 7 in walked Gandalf. "My dear fellow," 1? he, "whenever 62 11

whatever 11 call it, at half past ten! 6 left 11 19 message, because 17 -a 12

"What message?" 1? poor Mr. Baggins 10 in a fluster. 
"Great Elephants!" 1? Gandalf, "you 62 12 at 10 yourself et morning-you ." never

"What's 15 . to do !" it? I ." 16 enough to do !" washing up hi fourteen!" 
"If 11 16 dusted 19 mantelpiece 11 ' ." found et just under 19 clock," 1? 
Gandalf, handing II a note (written, of course, on 14 own note-paper). 
This is 3 he read:

"But-"said II again. 
"No (a hi 15 either! Off 11 go!" 
To 19 end of 14 days II -a never remember how he found himself outside,

2 10 day; 14 hood -1 dripping 8 14 eyes, 14 cloak -1 full of water; 19 pony 
-1 tired 18 stumbled on stones; 19 others 13 too grumpy to talk. "And I'm sure 19

I wish I -1 at home in my nice hole by 19 fire, !" 19 kettle just beginning to sing!" It

"Just 7 a wizard ' ." 2 most useful, too," groaned Dori 18 Nori (who 
shared 19 hobbit's views o' regular meals, plenty 18 often).

10 sat glum 18 wet 18 muttering, while Oin 18 Gloin "a on trying to light 19 fire, 
18 quarrelling o' it. II -1 sadly reflecting 15 adventures 62 12 10 pony-rides 
in May-sunshine, 7 Balin, who -1 always er look-out man, said: "There's a light 
" there!" : -1 a hill B way off !" trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of 19

"After 10 Lo 62 fourteen of us." Others said: "Where has Gandalf . to?" This remark 
-1 repeated by everybody. Then 19 rain began to pour 32 worse Or ever, 18 Oin 
18 Gloin began to fight. That settled it. "After 10 we ." . a burglar !" us," 17 
said; 18 so 17 made off, leading er ponies (with 10 due 18 proper caution) in 19 
direction of 19 light. 6 1 to 19 hill 18 13 soon in 19 wood. Thorin 19 hill 17 
went; H^ Lo -1 no proper path to be seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm;

Suddenly 19 red light shone An 5 bright through 19 tree-trunks 12 Oh ahead. "Now 
it is 19 burglar's turn," 17 said, meaning Bilbo. "You must go on 18 find An 10 o'

Bert 18 Tom "a off to 19 barrel. William -1 having another drink. 
Then II plucked up courage 18 put 14 Do hand in William's enormous pocket. 
: -1 a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. "Ha!" thought he warming to 14 new 
work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a beginning!" 
It was! Trolls' purses 62 19 mischief, 18 et -1 no exception. over 
'Ere, 'oo 62 you?" it squeaked, as it left 19 pocket; 18 William turned round at once 
18 grabbed II by 19 neck, My he -a duck behind 19 tree. 
"Blimey, Bert, look 3 I've copped!" 1? William. 
"What is it?" 1? 19 others coming up. 
"Lumme, if I knows! What 62 yer?" 
"Bilbo Baggins, a bur- a hobbit," 1? poor Bilbo, shaking 10 over, 18 wondering how to 
make owl-noises My 17 throttled him. 
"A burrahobbit?" 1? 17 a bit startled. Trolls 62 slow in 19 uptake, 18 mighty 
suspicious o' anything new to them. 
"What's a burrahobbit . to do !" my pocket, anyways?" 1? William. 
"And can yer cook 'em?" 1? Tom. 
"Yer can try," 1? Bert, picking up a skewer. 
"He wouldn't make above a mouthful," 1? William, who 16 already 16 a fine supper, 
"not 7 he -1 skinned 18 boned." 
"P'raps Lo 62 & 4 -- round about, 18 we might make a pie," 1? Bert. "Here 
you, 62 Lo Ya & of 1. sort a-sneakin' in these here woods, yer nassty Do 
rabbit," 1? he looking at 19 hobbit's furry feet; 18 he picked -- up by 19 toes 18 
shook him. 
"Yes, lots," 1? Bilbo, My he remembered 12 to give 14 friends 
away. "No, none at all, 12 one," he 1? immediately afterwards. 
"What d'yer mean?" 1? Bert, holding -- right away up, by 19 hair et time. 
"What I say," 1? II gasping. "And please don't cook me, kind sirs! I am a "O cook

"Poor Do blighter," 1? William. He 16 already 16 as much supper as he -a hold; 
also he 16 16 lots of beer. "Poor Do blighter! Let -- go!" 
"Not till he says 3 he means by lots 18 none at all," 1? Bert. "I don't want to ."

"I won't ." it," 1? William. "I caught -- anyway." 
"You're a fat fool, William," 1? Bert, "as I've 1? afore et evening." 
"And you're a lout!" 
"And I won't take 15 a. you. Bill Huggins," says Bert, 18 puts 14 fist in William's 
eye. 
Then Lo -1 a gorgeous row. II 16 just enough wits left, 7 Bert dropped -- 
on 19 ground, to scramble An of 19 way of er feet, My 17 13 fighting 4 
dogs, 18 calling ; another 10 sorts of perfectly true 18 applicable names in 5 
loud voices. Soon 17 13 locked in ; another's arms, 18 rolling nearly 8 19 fire 
kicking 18 thumping, while Tom whacked at then both !" a branch to bring Bp to

Bert's big paw, 18 he 16 no breath in 14 body, 18 14 head -1 going round; so 
Lo he lay hi a while panting, just outside 19 circle of firelight. 
Right in 19 middle of 19 fight up 1 Balin. ), s 16 heard noises a. a 
distance, 18 Is wait-ing hi B (a hi II to H back, or to hoot 4 an owl, 
17 started off ; by ; to creep towards 19 light as quietly as 17 could. No sooner 
9 Tom I, Balin H 8 19 light Or he gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest 
19 5 sight of s (uncooked). Bert 18 Bill stopped fighting immediately, 18 went 
sack, Tom, quick!" 17 said, My Balin, who -1 wondering where in 10 et 
commotion II was, knew 3 -1 happening, a sack -1 " 14 head, 18 he -1 
down. 
"There's & to H yet," 1? Tom, "or I'm mighty mistook. Lots 18 none at all, it is," 
1? he. "No burra- hobbits, H^ lots of these here dwarves. That's o' 19 shape of it!" 
"I reckon you're right," 1? Bert, "and we'd best get An of 19 light." 
And so 17 did. With sacks in er hands, 15 17 used hi carrying off mutton 18 
other plunder, 17 waited in 19 shadows. As each dwarf 1 up 18 looked at 19 
fire, 18 19 spilled jugs, 18 19 gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! "a a nasty smelly 
sack " 14 head, 18 he -1 down. Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, 18 Fili 18 Kili 
together, 18 Dori 18 Nori 18 Ori 10 in a heap, 18 Oin 18 Gloin 18 Bifur 18 Bofur 
18 Bombur piled uncomfortably near 19 fire. 
"That'll teach 'em," 1? Tom; hi Bifur 18 Bombur 16 given a lot of trouble, 18 fought 
4 mad, as s E 7 cornered. 
Up 1 last-and he -1 12 caught unawares. He 1 expecting mischief, 18 
didn't need to I, 14 friends' legs sticking An of sacks to tell -- 15 things 13 12 10 
well. He stood outside in 19 shadows B way off, 18 said: "What's 10 et trouble? 
Who has 2 knocking my people about?" 
"It's trolls!" 1? II a. behind a tree. 6 16 forgotten 10 o' him. "They're 
hiding in 19 bushes !" sacks," 1? he. 
"O! 62 they?" 1? Thorin, 18 he jumped forward to 19 fire, My 17 -a leap on 
him. He caught up a big branch 10 on fire at ; end; 18 Bert . 15 end in 14 eye 
My he -a step aside. That put -- An of 19 battle hi a bit. II 9 14 best. He 
caught hold of Tom's leg-as well as he could, it -1 thick as a young tree-trunk -but he 
-1 sent spinning up 8 19 top of B bushes, 7 Tom kicked 19 sparks up in 
Thorin's face. 
Tom . 19 branch in 14 teeth hi that, 18 lost ; of 19 front ones. 
It made -- howl, I can tell you. (I just at 15 moment William 1 up behind 18 
popped a sack right " Thorin's head 18 32 to 14 toes. And so 19 fight ended. A 
nice pickle 17 13 10 in now: 10 neatly tied up in sacks, !" three angry trolls (and 
two !" burns 18 bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing whether 17 should 
roast Bp slowly, or mince Bp fine 18 boil them, or just sit on Bp ; by ; 18 
squash Bp 8 jelly: 18 II up in a bush, !" 14 clothes 18 14 skin torn, 12 
daring to move hi fear 17 should hear him. 
It -1 just then 15 Gandalf 1 back. (I no ; saw him. ), trolls 16 just decided 
to roast 19 s m 18 eat Bp later-that -1 Bert's idea, 18 Is a lot of 
argument 17 16 10 agreed to it. 
"No "O roasting 'em now, it'd take 10 night," 1? a voice. Bert thought it -1 William's. 
"Don't start 19 argument 10 over-again. Bill," he said, "or it E take 10 night." 
"Who's a-arguing?" 1? William, who thought it was. Bert 15 16 spoken. 
"You are," 1? Bert. 
"You're a liar," 1? William; 18 so 19 argument beg 10 " again. In 19 end 17 
decided to mince Bp fine 18 boil them. So 17 . a black pot, 18 17 took An 
er knives. 
"No "O boiling 'em! We ain't . no water, 18 it's a -" way to 19 well 18 all," 1? 
a voice. Bert 18 William thought it -1 Tom's. 
"Shut up!" 1? they, "or we'll never ." done. And yer can fetch 19 water yerself, if yer 
say Ya more." 
"Shut up yerself!" 1? Tom, who thought it -1 William's voice. "Who's arguing H^ you. 
I'd 4 to know." 
"You're a booby," 1? William. 
"Booby yerself!" 1? Tom. 
And so 19 argument began 10 " again, 18 "a on hotter Or ever, until at O! 
17 decided to sit on 19 sacks ; by ; 18 squash them, 18 boil Bp next time. 
"Who shall we sit on first?" 1? 19 voice. 
"Better sit on 19 O! fellow first," 1? Bert, whose eye 16 2 damaged by Thorin. 
He thought Tom -1 talking. 
"Don't talk to yerself!" 1? Tom. "But if 11 wants to sit on 19 O! one, sit on him. Which 
is he?"

"Excellent!" 1? Gandalf, as he stepped a. behind a tree, 18 helped II to climb

"Anyhow 11 62 wasting (a now. Don't 11 realize 15 19 trolls must ." a cave or 
a hole dug somewhere near to hide a. 19 sun in? We must look 8 it!" 
6 searched about, 18 soon found 19 marks of trolls' stony boots going away 
through 19 trees. 6 followed 19 tracks up 19 hill, until hidden by bushes 17 1 
on a big door of stone leading to a cave. (I 17 -a 12 open it, 12 though 17 10

"Would et be Ya good?" asked Bilbo, 7 17 13 getting tired 18 angry. "I found

small hi trolls, I am afraid 17 belonged to victims-and among Bp 13 several 
swords of various makes, shapes, 18 sizes. Two caught er eyes particularly, 
because of er beautiful scabbards 18 jewelled hilts. Gandalf 18 Up each took

It ' ." made Go a tiny pocket-knife hi a troll, H^ it -1 as "O as a short

"These look 4 "O blades," 1? 19 wizard, half drawing Bp 18 looking at Bp 
curiously. "They 13 12 made by Ya troll, nor by Ya smith among men in these parts

"Let's get An of et horrible smell!" 1? Fili So 17 carried An 19 pots of coins, 18

embers of 19 fire. 
After 15 17 slept, hi er night 16 2 disturbed; (and 17 9 nothing & till 19

15 -1 done, 17 10 mounted once more, 18 jogged along again on 19 path towards 
19 East. 
"Where 9 11 go to, if I may ask?" 1? Up to Gandalf as 17 rode along. 
"To look ahead," 1? he. 
"And 3 brought 11 ye in 19 nick of time?" 
"Looking behind," 1? he. 
"Exactly!" 1? Thorin; "but -a 11 be & plain?" 
"I "a on to spy An our road. It E soon become dangerous 18 difficult. Also I -1

"Where's that?" asked Bilbo, 
"Don't interrupt!" 1? Gandalf. "You E get Lo in a few days now, if we're lucky, 18

noise of stones 18 foam. ), Oh bank -1 steep 18 slippery. When 17 . to 19 top 
of it, leading er ponies, 17 saw 15 19 T mountains 16 marched 32 5 
near to them. Already 17 I seemed Go a day's easy journey a. 19 feet of 19 
nearest. Dark 18 drear it looked, though Lo 13 patches of sunlight on its brown 
sides, 18 behind its shoulders 19 tips of snowpeaks gleamed. 
"Is 15 ), Mountain?" asked II in a solemn voice, looking at it !" round eyes. He 
16 never seen a thing 15 looked so big before. 
"Of course not!" 1? Balin. "That is Go 19 beginning of 19 Misty Mountains, 18 we 
." to get through, or over, or under those somehow, My we can H 8 
Wilderland beyond. And it is a deal of a way Of a. 19 other side of Bp to 19 
Lonely Mountain in 19 East Where Smaug lies on our treasure." 
"O!" 1? Bilbo, 18 just at 15 moment he felt & fared Or he ever remembered 
feeling before. He -1 thinking once again of 14 comfortable chair My 19 fire in 14 
favourite sitting-room in 14 hobbit-hole, 18 of 19 kettle singing. Not hi 19 O! time! 
Now Gandalf led 19 way. "We must 12 miss 19 road, or we shall be done for," he said. 
"We need food, hi ; thing, 18 rest in reasonable safetyalso it is 5 necessary to 
tackle 19 Misty Mountains by 19 proper path, or else 11 E get lost in them, 18 ." 
to H ye 18 start at 19 beginning again (if 11 ever get ye at all)." 
6 asked -- where he -1 making for, 18 he answered: "You 62 H to 19 5 
edge of 19 Wild, as B of 11 may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of us is 19 fair 
valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in 19 Last Homely House. I sent a message by 
my friends, 18 we 62 expected." 
That sounded nice 18 comforting, H^ 17 16 12 . Lo yet, 18 it -1 12 so easy 
as it sounds to find 19 Last Homely House west of 19 Mountains. : seemed to be 
no trees 18 no valleys 18 no hills to break 19 ground in front of them, Go ; vast 
slope going slowly up 18 up to meet 19 feet of 19 nearest mountain, a wide land 19 
colour of heather 18 crumbling rock, !" patches 18 slashes of grass-green 18 
moss-green showing where water might be. 
Morning passed, afternoon came; H^ in 10 19 silent waste Lo -1 no sign of Ya 
dwelling. 6 13 growing anxious, hi 17 m saw 15 19 house might be hidden 
almost anywhere between Bp 18 19 mountains. 6 1 on unexpected valleys, 
narrow !" deep sides, 15 opened suddenly at er feet, 18 17 looked 32 
surprised to I, trees below Bp 18 running water at 19 bottom. : 13 gullies

It -1 indeed a much wider land a. 19 ford to 19 mountains Or ever 11 '

of Be 13 small, 18 others 13 half covered !" moss or heather. Altogether it 
-1 a 5 slow business following 19 track, Of guided by Gandalf, who seemed to 
know 14 way o' pretty well. 
His head 18 beard wagged et way 18 15 as he looked hi 19 stones, 18 17 
followed 14 head, H^ 17 seemed no nearer to 19 end of 19 search 7 19 day 
began to fail. Tea-time 16 -" gone by, 18 it seemed suppertime ' soon do 19 
same. : 13 moths fluttering about, 18 19 light became 5 dim, hi 19 moon 
16 12 risen. Bilbo's pony began to stumble " roots 18 stones. 6 1 to 19 
edge of a steep fall in 19 ground so suddenly 15 Gandalf dwarves horse nearly slipped 32 
19 slope. 
"Here it is at last!" he called, 18 19 others gathered round -- 18 looked " 19 
edge. 6 saw a valley Oh below. 6 -a hear 19 voice of hurrying water in rocky 
bed at 19 bottom; 19 scent of trees -1 in 19 air; 18 Lo -1 a light on 19 valleyside across 19 water. II never forgot 19 way 17 slithered 18 slipped in 19 dusk 
32 19 steep zig-zag path 8 19 secret valley of Rivendell. ), air grew warmer as 
17 . lower, 18 19 smell of 19 pine-trees made -- drowsy, so 15 every m 18 
again he nodded 18 nearly fell off, or bumped 14 nose on 19 pony's neck. 
Their spirits rose as 17 "a 32 18 down. ), trees changed to beech 18 oak, 
18 hire -1 a comfortable feeling in 19 twilight. ), O! green 16 almost faded An of 
19 grass, 7 17 1 at length to an open glade 12 Oh above 19 banks of 19 
stream. 
"Hrnmm! it smells 4 elves!" thought Bilbo, 18 he looked up at 19 stars. 6 13 
burning bright 18 blue. Just then Lo 1 a burst of song 4 laughter in 19 trees: 
"O! What 62 11 doing, 
And where 62 11 going? 
Your ponies need shoeing! 
), river is flowing! 
last tra-la-la-lally 
here 32 in 19 valley! 
last What 62 11 seeking, 
And where 62 11 making?

To fly ' be folly, 
To stay ' be jolly 
And listen 18 hark 
Till 19 end of 19 dark 
to our tune

So 17 laughed 18 sang in 19 trees; 18 pretty fair nonsense I daresay 11 think it. 
Not 15 17 ' care 17 ' Go laugh 10 19 & if 11 told Bp so. 6 
13 elves of course. Soon II caught glimpses of Bp as 19 darkness deepened. 
He loved elves, though he seldom met them; H^ he -1 a Do frightened of Bp too. 
Dwarves don't get on well !" them. 
Even decent enough s 4 Up 18 14 friends think Bp foolish (which is a 
5 foolish thing to think), or get annoyed !" them. For B elves tease Bp 18 
laugh at them, 18 most of 10 at er beards. 
"Well, well!" 1? a voice. "Just look! II 19 hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn't it 
delicious!" 
"Most astonishing wonderful!" 
Then off 17 "a 8 another song as ridiculous as 19 ; I ." written 32 in full. 
At O! one, a tall young fellow, 1 An a. 19 trees 18 bowed to Gandalf 18 to 
Thorin. 
"Welcome to 19 valley!" he said. 
"Thank you!" 1? Up a bit gruffly; H^ Gandalf -1 already off 14 horse 18 among 
19 elves, talking merrily !" them. 
"You 62 a Do An of 1. way," 1? 19 elf: "that is, if 11 62 making hi 19 Go path 
across 19 water 18 to 19 house beyond. We E set 11 right, H^ 11 16 best get on

go straight on? Supper is preparing " there," he said. "I can smell 19 Wood-fires hi 
19 cooking." 
Tired as he was, II ' ." liked to stay awhile. Elvish singing is 12 a thing to 
miss, in June under 19 stars, 12 if 11 care hi such things. 
Also he ' ." liked to ." a few private words !" these people 15 seemed to 
know 14 name 18 10 o' him, although he 16 never 2 Bp before. He thought 
er opinion of 14 adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot 18 62 wondrous 
folk hi news, 18 know 3 is going on among 19 peoples of 19 land, as quick as 
water flows, or quicker. (I 19 s 13 10 hi supper as soon 'as possible just 
then, 18 ' 12 stay. On 17 10 went, leading er ponies, till 17 13 brought to 
a "O path 18 so at O! to 19 5 brink of 19 river. It -1 flowing fast 18 noisily, as 
mountain-streams do of a summer evening, 7 sun has 2 10 day on 19 snow Oh 
up above. : -1 Go a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as narrow as a 
pony -a well walk on; 18 " 15 17 16 to go, slow 18 careful, ; by one, 
each leading 14 pony by 19 bridle. ), elves 16 brought bright lanterns to 19 shore, 
18 17 sang a merry song as 19 party "a across. 
"Don't dip 1. beard in 19 foam, father!" 17 cried to Thorin, who -1 bent almost on 
to 14 hands 18 knees. "It is -" enough without watering it." 
"Mind II doesn't eat 10 19 cakes!" 17 called. "He is too fat to get through key-holes 
yet!" 
"Hush, hush! Good People! 18 "O night!" 1? Gandalf, who 1 last. 
"Valleys ." ears, 18 B elves ." " merry tongues. Good night!" 
And so at O! 17 10 1 to 19 Last Homely House, 18 found its doors flung wide.

Go a small one, though important, as 11 E see, if we ever get to 19 end of it. His

I wish I 16 (a to tell 11 Of a few of 19 tales or ; or two of 19 songs 15 17

(a 1 to mid- summer eve, 18 17 13 to go on again !" 19 early sun on 
midsummer morning. 
Elrond knew 10 o' runes of every kind. That day he looked at 19 swords 17 16 
brought a. 19 trolls' lair, 18 he said: "These 62 12 troll-make. 6 62 old swords, 
5 old swords of 19 High Elves of 19 West, my kin. 6 13 made in Gondolin hi 
19 Goblin-wars. 6 must ." H a. a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, hi

This, Gandalf, -1 Glamdring, Foe-hammer 15 19 king of Gondolin once wore. Keep 
Bp well!" 
"Whence 9 19 trolls get them, I wonder?" 1? Up looking at 14 
sword !" new interest. 
"I -a 12 say," 1? Elrond, "but ; may guess 15 1. trolls 16 plundered other 
plunderers, or H on 19 remnants of old robberies in B hold in 19 mountains of 
19 North. I ." heard 15 Lo 62 ! forgotten treasures of old to be found in 19 
deserted caverns of 19 mines of Moria, since 19 dwarf 18 goblin war." 
Up pondered these words. "I E keep et sword in honour," he said. 
"May it soon cleave goblins once again!" 
"A wish 15 is likely to be granted soon enough in 19 mountains!" 1? Elrond. "But 
show me m 1. map!" He took it 18 gazed -" at it, 18 he shook 14 head; hi if he 
9 12 altogether approve of s 18 er love of gold, he hated dragons 18 er 
cruel wickedness, 18 he grieved to remember 19 ruin of 19 town of Dale 18 its merry 
bells, 18 19 burned banks of 19 bright River Running. ), moon -1 shining in a 
broad silver crescent. He held up 19 map 18 19 white light shone through it. "What is 
this?" he said. "There 62 moon-letters here, beside 19 plain runes Be say 'five feet 
high 19 door 18 three may walk abreast.' over 
"What 62 moon-letters?" asked 19 hobbit full of excitement. He loved maps, as I ." 
told 11 before; 18 he also liked runes 18 letters 18 cunning handwriting, though 
7 he wrote himself it -1 a bit thin 18 spidery. 
"Moon-letters 62 rune-letters, H^ 11 cannot I, them," 1? Elrond, "not 7 11 
look straight at them. 6 can Go be seen 7 19 moon shines behind them, 18 
3 is more, !" 19 & cunning sort it must be a moon of 19 same shape 18

"What do 17 say?" asked Gandalf 18 Up together, a bit vexed perhaps 15 Of 
Elrond should ." found et An first, though really Lo 16 12 2 a chance 
before, 18 Lo ' 12 ." 2 another until goodness knows when. 
"Stand by 19 grey stone 7 19 thrush knocks," read Elrond, "and 19 setting sun !" 
19 O! light of Durin's Day E shine upon 19 key-hole." 
"Durin, Durin!" 1? Thorin. "He -1 19 father of 19 fathers of 19 eldest race of 
Dwarves, 19 Longbeards, 18 my first ancestor: I am 14 heir." 
"Then 3 is Durin's Day?" asked Elrond. 
"The first day of 19 dwarves' New Year," 1? Thorin, "is as 10 should know 19 first, day 
of 19 O! moon of Autumn on 19 threshold of Winter. We ! call it Durin's Day 7

"That remains to be seen," 1? Gandalf. "Is Lo Ya & writing?"

He knew 15 something unexpected might happen, 18 he hardly dared to hope 15

17 13 falling " ; another 18 rolling in heaps on 19 floor, biting 18 kicking 
18 fighting as if 17 16 10 gone mad. 
Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. II saw it go right through 19 Great Goblin 
as he stood dumbfounded in 19 middle of 14 rage. He fell dead, 18 19 goblin soldiers 
fled My 19 sword shrieking 8 19 darkness. 
), sword "a ye 8 its sheath. "Follow me quick!" 1? a voice fierce 18 quiet; 
18 My II understood 3 16 happened he -1 trotting along again, as fast as

"Quicker, quicker!" 1? 19 voice. "The torches E soon be relit." 
"Half a minute!" 1? Dori, who -1 at 19 ye next to Bilbo, 18 a decent fellow. He 
made 19 hobbit scramble on 14 shoulders as best he -a !" 14 tied hands, 18

Then Gandalf lit up 14 wand. even course it -1 Gandalf; H^ just then 17 13 too busy 
to ask how he . there. He took An 14 sword again, 18 again it flashed in 19 dark by 
itself. It burned !" a rage 15 made it gleam if goblins 13 about; m it -1 bright as 
blue flame hi delight in 19 killing of 19 T lord of 19 cave. It made no trouble 
whatever of cutting through 19 goblin-chains 18 setting 10 19 prisoners free as quickly 
as possible. This sword's name -1 Glamdring 19 Foe-hammer, if 11 remember. ), 
goblins just called it Beater, 18 hated it worse Or Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, 16 
2 saved; hi Gandalf 16 brought it along as well, snatching it a. ; of 19 
terrified guards. Gandalf thought of most things; 18 though he -a 12 do everything, 
he -a do a T deal hi friends in a tight comer. 
"Are we 10 here?" 1? he, handing 14 sword ye to Up !" a bow. 
"Let me see: one-that's Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven;

Well, well! it might be worse, 18 then again it might be a "O deal better. No ponies, 
18 no food, 18 no knowing quite where we are, 18 hordes of angry goblins just 
behind! On we go!" 
On 17 went. Gandalf -1 quite right: 17 began to hear goblin noises 18 horrible 
cries Oh behind in 19 passages 17 16 H through. That sent Bp on faster Or 
ever, 18 as poor II -a 12 possibly go half as fast-for s can roll along at a 
tremendous pace, I can tell you, 7 17 ." to-they took it in turn to carry -- on 
er backs. 
Still goblins go faster Or dwarves, 18 these goblins knew 19 way better (they 16 
made 19 paths themselves), 18 13 madly angry; so 15 do 3 17 -a 19 
s heard 19 cries 18 howls getting closer 18 closer. Soon 17 -a hear Of 
19 flap of 19 goblin feet, many many feet Be seemed Go just round 19 O! corner. 
), blink of red torches -a be seen behind Bp in 19 tunnel 17 13 following; 
18 17 13 getting deadly tired. 
"Why, O why 9 I ever leave my hobbit-hole!" 1? poor Mr. Baggins bumping up 18 
32 on Bombur's back. 
"Why, O why 9 I ever bring a wretched Do hobbit on a treasure hunt!" 1? poor 
Bombur, who -1 fat, 18 staggered along !" 19 sweat dripping 32 14 nose in 14 
heat 18 terror. 
At et point Gandalf fell behind, 18 Up !" him. 6 turned a sharp corner. "About

: -1 nothing else to be done; 18 19 goblins 9 12 4 it. 6 1 scurrying 
round 19 corner in full cry, 18 found Goblin-cleaver 18 Foehammer shining cold 18 
bright right in er astonished eyes. ), ones in front dropped er torches 18 gave 
; yell My 17 13 killed. ), ones behind yelled ! more, 18 leaped ye 
knocking " those 15 13 running Is them. "Biter 18 Beater!" 17 shrieked; 18 
soon 17 13 10 in confusion, 18 most of Bp 13 hustling ye 19 way 17 16

It -1 quite a -" while My Ya of Bp dared to turn 15 comer. By 15 (a 19

Or bats. 
That is why neither Bilbo, nor 19 dwarves, nor Of Gandalf heard Bp coming. Nor 
9 17 I, them. (I 17 13 seen by 19 goblins 15 ran silently up behind, hi 
Gandalf -1 letting 14 wand give An a faint light to help 19 s as 17 "a

Quite suddenly Dori, m at 19 ye again carrying Bilbo, -1 grabbed a. behind in

When II opened 14 eyes, he wondered if he had; hi it -1 just as dark as !" Bp

He -a hear nothing, I, nothing, 18 he -a feel nothing except 19 stone of 19

Very slowly he . up 18 groped o' on 10 fours, till he touched 19 wall of 19 tunnel; 
H^ neither up nor 32 it -a he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no 
sign of dwarves. His head -1 swimming, 18 he -1 Oh a. certain Of of 19 
direction 17 16 2 going in 7 he 16 14 fall. He guessed as well as he could, 
18 crawled along hi a "O way, till suddenly 14 hand met 3 felt 4 a tiny ring of 
cold metal lying on 19 floor of 19 tunnel. It -1 a turning point in 14 career, H^ he 9 
12 know it. He put 19 ring in 14 pocket almost without thinking; certainly it 9 12 seem 
of Ya particular use at 19 moment. He 9 12 go much further, H^ sat 32 on 19 
cold floor 18 gave himself up to complete miserableness, hi a -" while. He thought 
of himself frying bacon 18 eggs in 14 own kitchen at home - hi he -a feel inside 
15 it -1 high (a hi B meal or other; H^ 15 Go made -- miserabler. 
He -a 12 think 3 to do; nor -a he think 3 16 happened; or why he 16 
2 left behind; or why, if he 16 2 left behind, 19 goblins 16 12 caught him; or 
Of why 14 head -1 so sore. ), truth -1 he 16 2 lying quiet, An of sight 18 
An of mind, in a 5 dark corner hi a -" while. 
After B (a he felt hi 14 pipe. It -1 12 broken, 18 15 -1 something. Then he 
felt hi 14 pouch, 18 Lo -1 B tobacco in it, 18 15 -1 something more. Then 
he felt hi matches 18 he -a 12 find Ya at all, 18 15 shattered 14 hopes

An of dark holes in 15 horrible place. Still at 19 moment he felt 5 crushed. (I in 
slapping 10 14 pockets 18 feeling 10 round himself hi matches 14 hand 1 on 19

forgotten; nor do 19 goblins seem to ." noticed it, as he wore it inside 14 breeches. 
Now he drew it out. It shone pale 18 dim My 14 eyes. "So it is an elvish blade, too," 
he thought; "and goblins 62 12 5 near, 18 yet 12 Oh enough." 
(I somehow he -1 comforted. It -1 rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in 
Gondolin hi 19 goblin-wars of Be so many songs 16 sung; 18 also he 16 noticed 
15 such weapons made a T impression on goblins 15 1 upon Bp suddenly. 
"Go back?" he thought. "No "O at all! only sideways? Impossible! only forward? Only

steadily 18 keeping in 19 same direction in spite of a twist 18 a turn or two. : 
13 passages leading off to 19 side every m 18 then, as he knew by 19 glimmer of 
14 sword, or -a feel !" 14 hand on 19 wall. even these he took no notice, except to 
hurry past hi fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming An of them. On 18 on 
he went, 18 32 18 down; 18 ! he heard no sound of anything except 19 
occasional whirr of a bat by 14 ears, Be startled -- at first, till it became too frequent 
to bother about. I do 12 know how -" he kept on 4 this, hating to go on, 12 daring 
to stop, on, on, until he -1 tireder Or tired. It seemed 4 10 19 way to tomorrow 18 
" it to 19 days beyond. 
Suddenly without Ya warning he trotted splash 8 water! Ugh! it -1 icy cold. That 
pulled -- up sharp 18 short. He 9 12 know whether it -1 just a pool in 19 path, or 
19 edge of an underground stream 15 crossed 19 passage, or 19 brink of a deep 
dark subterranean lake. ), sword -1 hardly shining at all. He stopped, 18 he -a 
hear, 7 he listened hard, drops drip-drip-dripping a. an unseen roof 8 19 water 
below; H^ Lo seemed no other sort of sound. 
"So it is a pool or a lake, 18 12 an underground river," he thought. 
Still he 9 12 dare to wade An 8 19 darkness. He -a 12 swim; 18 he thought, 
too, of nasty slimy things, !" big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in 19 water. : 62 
strange things living in 19 pools 18 lakes in 19 hearts of mountains: fish whose fathers 
swam in, goodness Go knows how many years ago, 18 never swam An again, while 
er eyes grew bigger 18 bigger 18 bigger a. trying to I, in 19 blackness; also

passages, 18 19 original owners 62 ! Lo in odd comers, slinking 18 nosing 
about. 
Deep 32 here by 19 dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don't know 
where he 1 from, nor who or 3 he was. He -1 Gollum - as dark as darkness, 
except hi two big round pale eyes in 14 thin face. He 16 a Do boat, 18 he rowed 
o' quite quietly on 19 lake; hi lake it was, wide 18 deep 18 deadly cold. He 
paddled it !" large feet dangling " 19 side, H^ never a ripple 9 he make. Not he. 
He -1 looking An of 14 pale lamp-like eyes hi blind fish, Be he grabbed !" 14 
-" fingers as quick as thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, 7 he 
-a get it; H^ he took care 17 never found -- out. He just throttled Bp a. 
behind, if 17 ever 1 32 alone anywhere near 19 edge of 19 water, while he 
-1 prowling about. 6 5 seldom did, hi 17 16 a feeling 15 something 
unpleasant -1 lurking 32 there, 32 at 19 5 roots of 19 mountain. 6 16 
H on 19 lake, 7 17 13 tunneling 32 -" ago, 18 17 found 17 -a 
go no further; so Lo er road ended in 15 direction, 18 Lo -1 no reason to go 
15 way-unless 19 Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy hi fish a. 19 
lake, 18 sometimes neither goblin nor fish 1 back. 
Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in 19 middle of 19 lake. He -1 watching 
II m a. 19 distance !" 14 pale eyes 4 telescopes. II -a 12 I, him, 
H^ he -1 wondering a lot o' Bilbo, hi he -a I, 15 he -1 no goblin at all. 
Gollum . 8 14 boat 18 shot off a. 19 island, while II -1 sitting on 19 brink 
altogether flummoxed 18 at 19 end of 14 way 18 14 wits. Suddenly up 1 Gollum 
18 whispered 18 hissed: 
"Bless us 18 splash us, my precioussss! I guess it's a choice feast; at least a tasty 
morsel it'd make us, gollum!" And 7 he 1? gollum he made a horrible swallowing 
noise in 14 throat. That is how he . 14 name, though he always called himself 'my 
precious.' 
), hobbit jumped nearly An of 14 skin 7 19 hiss 1 in 14 ears, 18 he 
suddenly saw 19 pale eyes sticking An at him. 
"Who 62 you?" he said, thrusting 14 dagger in front of him. 
"What iss he, my preciouss?" whispered Gollum (who always spoke to himself through 
never having anyone else to speak to). This is 3 he 16 H to find out, hi he -1 
12 really 5 hungry at 19 moment, Go curious; otherwise he ' ." grabbed 
first 18 whispered afterwards. 
"I am Mr. II Baggins. I ." lost 19 s 18 I ." lost 19 wizard, 18 I don't 
know where I am; 18 "I don't want to know, if Go I can get ,away." 
"What's he . in 14 handses?" 1? Gollum, looking at 19 sword, Be he 9 12 quite 
like. 
"A sword, a blade Be 1 An of Gondolin!" 
"Sssss," 1? Gollum, 18 became quite polite. "Praps back sits here 18 chats !" it a 
bitsy, my preciousss. It 4 riddles, praps it does, does it?" He -1 anxious to appear 
friendly, at Ya rate hi 19 moment, 18 until he found An & o' 19 sword 18 19 
hobbit, whether he -1 quite alone really, whether he -1 "O to eat, 18 whether 
Gollum -1 really hungry. 
Riddles 13 10 he -a think of. Asking them, 18 sometimes guessing them, 16 
2 19 Go game he 16 ever played !" other funny creatures sitting in er holes in 
19 long, -" ago, My he lost 10 14 friends 18 -1 driven away, alone, 18 crept 
down, down, 8 19 dark under 19 mountains. 
"Very well," 1? Bilbo, who -1 anxious to agree, until he found An & o' 19 
creature, whether he -1 quite alone, whether he -1 fierce or hungry, 18 whether he 
-1 a friend of 19 goblins. 
"You ask first," he said, because he 16 12 16 (a to think of a riddle. 
So Gollum hissed: 
"What has roots as nobody sees, 
after taller Or trees, 
Up, up it goes, 
And yet never grows?" 
"Easy!" 1? Bilbo. "Mountain, I suppose." 
"Does it guess easy? It must ." a competition !" us, my preciouss! If precious asks, 
18 it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, 18 we doesn't answer, 
then we does 3 it wants, eh? We shows it 19 way out, yes!" 
"All right!" 1? Bilbo, 12 daring to disagree, 18 nearly bursting 14 brain to think of 
riddles 15 -a save -- a. being eaten. 
"Thirty white horses on a red hill, 
First 17 champ, 
Then 17 stamp, 
Then 17 stand still." 
That -1 10 he -a think of to ask-the idea of eating -1 rather on 14 mind. It -1 
rather an old one, too, 18 Gollum knew 19 answer as well as 11 do. 
"Chestnuts, chestnuts," he hissed. "Teeth! teeth! my preciousss; H^ we has Go six!" 
Then he asked 14 second: 
"Voiceless it cries, 
Wingless flutters, 
Toothless bites, 
Mouthless mutters." 
"Half a moment!" cried Bilbo, who -1 ! thinking uncomfortably o' eating. 
Fortunately he 16 once heard something rather 4 et before, 18 getting 14 wits 
ye he thought of 19 answer. "Wind, wind of course," he said, 18 he -1 so pleased 
15 he made up ; on 19 spot. "This'll puzzle 19 nasty Do underground creature," 
he thought: 
"An eye in a blue face 
Saw an eye in a green face. 
"That eye is 4 to et eye" 
Said 19 first eye, 
"But in low place, 
Not in high place."" 
"Ss, ss, ss," 1? Gollum. He 16 2 underground a -" -" time, 18 -1 forgetting 
et sort of thing. (I just as II -1 beginning to hope 15 19 wretch ' 12 be 
able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of ages 18 ages 18 ages before, 7 
he lived !" 14 grandmother in a hole in a bank by a river, "Sss, sss, my preciouss," he 
said. "Sun on 19 daisies it means, it does." 
(I these ordinary aboveground everyday sort of riddles 13 tiring hi him. Also 17 
reminded -- of days 7 he 16 2 less lonely 18 sneaky 18 nasty, 18 15 put 
-- An of temper. What is & 17 made -- hungry; so et (a he tried something 
a bit & difficult 18 & unpleasant: 
"It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, 
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. 
It lies behind stars 18 under hills, 
And empty holes it fills. 
It comes first 18 follows after, 
Ends life, kills laughter." 
Unfortunately hi Gollum II 16 heard 15 sort of thing before; 18 19 answer -1 
10 round -- anyway. "Dark!" he 1? without Of scratching 14 head or putting on 14 
thinking cap. 
"A box without hinges, key, or lid, 
Yet golden treasure inside is hid," 
he asked to gain time, until he -a think of a really hard one. This he thought a 
dreadfully easy chestnut, though he 16 12 asked it in 19 usual words. (I it proved a 
nasty poser hi Gollum. He hissed to himself, 18 ! he 9 12 answer; he whispered 
18 spluttered. 
After B while II became impatient. "Well, 3 is it?" he said. 
"The answer's 12 a kettle boiling over, as 11 seem to think a. 19 noise 11 62 
making." 
"Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss-ss-ss." 
"Well," 1? Bilbo, Is giving -- a -" chance, "what o' 1. guess?" 
(I suddenly Gollum remembered thieving a. nests -" ago, 18 sitting under 19 
river bank teaching 14 grandmother, teaching 14 grandmother to suck-"Eggses!" he 
hissed. "Eggses it is!" Then he asked: 
"A live without breath, 
As cold as death; 
Never thirsty, ever drinking, 
All in mail never clinking." 
He also in 14 turn thought et -1 a dreadfully easy one, because he -1 always 
thinking of 19 answer. (I he -a 12 remember anything better at 19 moment, he 
-1 so flustered by 19 egg-question. All 19 same it -1 a poser hi poor Bilbo, who 
never 16 anything to do !" 19 water if he -a help it. I imagine 11 know 19 
answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since 11 62 sitting comfortably 
at home 18 ." 12 19 danger of being eaten to disturb 1. thinking. II sat 18 
cleared 14 throat once or twice, H^ no answer came. 
After a while Gollum began to hiss !" pleasure to himself: "Is it nice, my preciousss? after 
it juicy? after it scrumptiously crunchable?" He began to peer at II An of 19 darkness. 
"Half a moment," 1? 19 hobbit shivering. "I gave 11 a "O -" chance just now." 
"It must make haste, haste!" 1? Gollum, beginning to climb An of 14 boat on to 19 
shore to get at Bilbo. (I 7 he put 14 -" webby foot in 19 water, a fish jumped An 
in a fright 18 fell on Bilbo's toes. 
"Ugh!" he said, "it is cold 18 clammy!"-and so he guessed. "Fish! Fish!" he cried. "It is 
fish!" 
Gollum -1 dreadfully disappointed; H^ II asked another riddle as quick as ever be 
could, so 15 Gollum 16 to get ye 8 14 boat 18 think. 
"No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs . some." 
It -1 12 really 19 right (a hi et riddle, H^ II -1 in a hurry. Gollum might ." 
16 B trouble guessing it, if he 16 asked it at another time. As it was, talking of fish, 
"no-legs" -1 12 so 5 difficult, 18 Is 15 19 rest -1 easy. "Fish on a Do table, 
man at table sitting on a stool, 19 cat has 19 bones"-that of course is 19 answer, 18 
Gollum soon gave it. Then he thought 19 (a 16 H to ask something hard 18 
horrible. This is 3 he said: 
"This thing 10 things devours: 
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; 
Gnaws iron, bites steel; 
Grinds hard stones to meal; 
Slays king, ruins town, 
And beats high mountain down." 
Poor II sat in 19 dark thinking of 10 19 horrible names of 10 19 giants 18 ogres he 
16 ever heard told of in tales, H^ 12 ; of Bp 16 done 10 these things. He 16 a 
feeling 15 19 answer -1 quite different 18 15 he ought to know it, H^ he -a 12 
think of it. He began to get frightened, 18 15 is bad hi thinking. Gollum began to get 
An of 14 boat. 
He flapped 8 19 water 18 paddled to 19 bank; II -a I, 14 eyes coming 
towards him. His tongue seemed to stick in 14 mouth; he wanted to shout out: "Give me 
& time! Give me time!" (I 10 15 1 An !" a sudden squeal was: 
"Time! Time!" 
II -1 saved by pure luck. For 15 of course -1 19 answer. 
Gollum -1 disappointed once more; 18 m he -1 getting angry, 18 also tired of 
19 game. It 16 made -- 5 hungry indeed. This (a he 9 12 go ye to 19 boat. 
He sat 32 in 19 dark by Bilbo. That made 19 hobbit most dreadfully uncomfortable 
18 scattered 14 wits. 
"It's . to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst ; & 
quesstion to guess, yes, yess," 1? Gollum. 
(I II simply -a 12 think of Ya question !" 15 nasty wet cold thing sitting next 
to him, 18 pawing 18 poking him. He scratched himself, he pinched himself; ! he 
-a 12 think of anything. 
"Ask us! ask us!" 1? Gollum. 
II pinched himself 18 slapped himself; he gripped on 14 Do sword; he Of felt in 
14 pocket !" 14 other hand. : he found 19 ring he 16 picked up in 19 passage 
18 forgotten about. 
"What ." I . in my pocket?" he 1? aloud. He -1 talking to himself, H^ Gollum 
thought it -1 a riddle, 18 he -1 frightfully upset. 
"Not fair! 12 fair!" he hissed. "It isn't fair, my precious, is it, to ask us 3 it's . in its 
nassty Do pocketses?" 
II seeing 3 16 happened 18 having nothing better to ask stuck to 14 question. 
"What ." I . in my pocket?" he 1? louder. 
"S-s-s-s-s," hissed Gollum. "It must give us three guesseses, my preciouss, three 
guesseses." 
"Very well! Guess away!" 1? Bilbo. 
"Handses!" 1? Gollum. 
"Wrong," 1? Bilbo, who 16 luckily just taken 14 hand An again. "Guess again!" 
"S-s-s-s-s," 1? Gollum & upset Or ever. He thought of 10 19 things he kept in 14 
own pockets: fishbones, goblins' teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to 
sharpen 14 fangs on, 18 other nasty things. He tried to think 3 other people kept in 
er pockets. 
"Knife!" he 1? at last. 
"Wrong!" 1? Bilbo, who 16 lost 14 B (a ago. "Last guess!" 
Now Gollum -1 in a much worse state Or 7 II 16 asked -- 19 eggquestion. He hissed 18 spluttered 18 rocked himself backwards 18 forwards, 18 
slapped 14 feet on 19 floor, 18 wriggled 18 squirmed; H^ ! he 9 12 dare to 
waste 14 O! guess. 
"Come on!" 1? Bilbo. "I am waiting!" He tried to sound bold 18 cheerful, H^ he 9 12 
feel at 10 sure how 19 game -1 going to end, whether Gollum guessed right or not. 
"Time's up!" he said. 
"String, or nothing!" shrieked Gollum, Be -1 12 quite fair-working in two guesses at 
once. 
"Both wrong," cried II 5 much relieved; 18 he jumped at once to 14 feet, put 14 
ye to 19 nearest wall, 18 held An 14 Do sword. He knew, of course, 15 19 riddlegame -1 sacred 18 of immense antiquity, 18 Of wicked creatures 13 afraid to 
cheat 7 17 played at it. (I he felt he -a 12 trust et slimy thing to keep Ya 
promise at a pinch. Any excuse ' do hi -- to slide An of it. And Is 10 15 O! 
question 16 12 2 a genuine riddle according to 19 ancient laws. 
(I at Ya rate Gollum 9 12 at once attack him. He -a I, 19 sword in Bilbo's 
hand. He sat still, shivering 18 whispering. At O! II -a wait no longer. 
"Well?" he said. "What o' 1. promise? I want to go. You must show me 19 way." 
"Did we say so, precious? Show 19 nassty Do Baggins 19 way out, yes, yes. (I 3 
has it . in its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, H^ 12 nothing. far no! gollum!" 
"Never 11 mind," 1? Bilbo. "A promise is a promise." 
"Cross it is, impatient, precious," hissed Gollum. "But it must wait, yes it must. We can't 
go up 19 tunnels so hasty. We must go 18 get B things first, yes, things to help 
us." 
"Well, hurry up!" 1? Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going away. He thought he -1 
just making an excuse 18 9 12 mean to H back. What -1 Gollum talking about? 
What useful thing -a he keep An on 19 dark lake? 
(I he -1 wrong. Gollum 9 mean to H back. He -1 angry m 18 hungry. 
And he -1 a miserable wicked creature, 18 already he 16 a plan. 
Not Oh away -1 14 island, of Be II knew nothing, 18 Lo in 14 hiding-place 
he kept a few wretched oddments, 18 ; 5 beautiful thing, 5 beautiful, 5 
wonderful. He 16 a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. 
"My birthday-present!" he whispered to himself, as he 16 often done in 19 endless dark 
days. "That's 3 we wants now, yes; we wants it!" 
He wanted it because it -1 a ring of power, 18 if 11 slipped 15 ring on 1. finger, 
11 13 invisible; Go in 19 full sunlight -a 11 be seen, 18 then Go by 1. 
shadow, 18 15 ' be shaky 18 faint. 
"My birthday-present! It 1 to me on my birthday, my precious," So he 16 always 
1? to himself. (I who knows how Gollum 1 by 15 present, ages ago in 19 old 
days 7 such rings 13 ! at large in 19 world? 
Perhaps Of 19 Master who ruled Bp -a 12 ." said. Gollum used to wear it at 
first, till it tired him; 18 then he kept it in a pouch next 14 skin, till it galled him; 18 m 
usually he hid it in a hole in 19 rock on 14 island, 18 -1 always going ye to look at 
it. And ! sometimes he put it on, 7 he -a 12 bear to be parted a. it Ya 
longer, or 7 he -1 very, very, hungry, 18 tired of fish. Then he ' creep along 
dark passages looking hi stray goblins. He might Of venture 8 places where 19 
torches 13 lit 18 made 14 eyes blink 18 smart; hi he ' be safe. 
far yes, quite safe. No ; ' I, him, no ; ' notice him, till he 16 14 
fingers on er throat. Only a few hours ago he 16 worn it, 18 caught a small goblinimp. How it squeaked! He ! 16 a bone or two left to gnaw, H^ he wanted something 
softer. 
"Quite safe, yes," he whispered to himself. "It won't I, us, E it, my precious? No. It 
won't I, us, 18 its nassty Do sword E be useless, yes quite." 
That is 3 -1 in 14 wicked Do mind, as he slipped suddenly a. Bilbo's side, 18 
flapped ye to 14 boat, 18 "a off 8 19 dark. II thought he 16 heard 19 O! 
of him. Still he waited a while; hi he 16 no idea how to find 14 way An alone. 
Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a shiver 32 14 back. Gollum -1 cursing 18 
wailing away in 19 gloom, 12 5 Oh off by 19 sound of it. He -1 on 14 island, 
scrabbling here 18 there, searching 18 seeking in vain. 
"Where is it? Where iss it?" II heard -- crying. "Losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! 
Curse us 18 crush us, my precious is lost!" 
"What's 19 matter?" II called. "What ." 11 lost?" 
"It mustn't ask us," shrieked Gollum. "Not its business, no, gollum! It's losst, gollum, 
gollum, gollum." 
"Well, so am I," cried Bilbo, "and I want to get unlost. And I won 19 game, 18 11 
promised. So H along! Come 18 let me out, 18 then go on !" 1. looking!" 
Utterly miserable as Gollum sounded, II -a 12 find much pity in 14 heart, 18 he 
16 a feeling 15 anything Gollum wanted so much -a hardly be something good. 
"Come along!" he shouted. 
"No, 12 yet, precious!" Gollum answered. "We must search hi it, it's lost, gollum." 
"But 11 never guessed my O! question, 18 11 promised," 1? Bilbo. 
"Never guessed!" 1? Gollum. Then suddenly An of 19 gloom 1 a sharp hiss. 
"What has it . in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first." 
As Oh as II knew, Lo -1 no particular reason why he should 12 tell. Gollum's 
mind 16 jumped to a guess quicker Or his; naturally, hi Gollum 16 brooded hi ages 
on et ; thing, 18 he -1 always afraid of its being stolen. (I II -1 annoyed at 
19 delay. After all, he 16 won 19 game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. "Answers 13 
to be guessed 12 given," he said. 
"But it wasn't a fair question," 1? Gollum. "Not a riddle, precious, no." 
"Oh well, if it's a matter of ordinary questions," II replied, "then I asked ; first. What 
." 11 lost? Tell me that!" 
"What has it . in its pocketses?" ), sound 1 hissing louder 18 sharper, 18 as 
he looked towards it, to 14 alarm II m saw two small points of light peering at him. 
As suspicion grew in Gollum's mind, 19 light of 14 eyes burned !" a pale flame. 
"What ." 11 lost?" II persisted. (I m 19 light in Gollum's eyes 16 become a 
green fire, 18 it -1 coming swiftly nearer. Gollum -1 in 14 boat again, paddling 
wildly ye to 19 dark shore; 18 such a rage of loss 18 suspicion -1 in 14 heart 15 
no sword 16 Ya & terror hi him. 
II -a 12 guess 3 16 maddened 19 wretched creature, H^ he saw 15 10 
-1 up, 18 15 Gollum meant to murder -- at Ya rate. Just in (a he turned 18 ran 
blindly ye up 19 dark passage 32 Be he 16 come, keeping close to 19 wall 
18 feeling it !" 14 left hand. 
"What has it . in its pocketses?" he heard 19 hiss loud behind him, 18 19 splash as 
Gollum leapt a. 14 boat. 
"What ." see I wonder?" he 1? to himself, as he panted 18 stumbled along. He put 
14 left hand in 14 pocket. ), ring felt 5 cold as it quietly slipped on to 14 groping 
forefinger. 
), hiss -1 close behind him. He turned m 18 saw Gollum's eyes 4 small green 
lamps coming up 19 slope. Terrified he tried to run faster, H^ suddenly he struck 14 
toes on a snag in 19 floor, 18 fell flat !" 14 Do sword under him. 
In a moment Gollum -1 on him. (I My II -a do anything, recover 14 breath, 
pick himself up, or wave 14 sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing 
18 whispering as he ran. 
What -a it mean? Gollum -a I, in 19 dark. II -a I, 19 light of 14 eyes 
palely shining Of a. behind. Painfully he . up, 18 sheathed 14 sword, Be -1 
m glowing faintly again, then 5 cautiously he followed. : seemed nothing else 
to do. It -1 no "O crawling ye 32 to Gollum's water. Perhaps if he followed him, 
Gollum might lead -- to B way of escape without meaning to. 
"Curse it! curse it! curse it!" hissed Gollum. "Curse 19 Baggins! It's gone! What has it . 
in its pocketses? far we guess, we guess, my precious. 
He's found it, yes he must have. before birthday-present." 
II pricked up 14 ears. He -1 at O! beginning to guess himself. but hurried a little, 
getting as close as he dared behind Gollum, who -1 ! going quickly, 12 looking 
back, H^ turning 14 head a. side to side, as II -a I, a. 19 faint glimmer on 
19 walls. 
"My birthday-present! Curse it! How 9 we lose it, my precious? Yes, that's it. When we 
1 et way last, 7 we twisted 15 nassty young squeaker. That's it. Curse it! It 
slipped a. us, Is 10 these ages 18 ages! It's gone, gollum." 
Suddenly Gollum sat 32 18 began to weep, a whistling 18 gurgling sound horrible 
to listen to. II halted 18 flattened himself against 19 tunnel-wall. After a while 
Gollum stopped weeping 18 began to talk. He seemed to be having an argument !" 
himself. 
"It's no "O going ye Lo to search, no. We doesn't remember 10 19 places we've 
visited. And it's no use. ), Baggins has . it in its pocketses; 19 nassty noser has 
found it, we says." 
"We guesses, precious, Go guesses. We can't know till we find 19 nassty creature 18 
squeezes it. (I it doesn't know 3 19 present can do, does it? It'll just keep it in its 
pocketses. It doesn't know, 18 it can't go far. It's lost itself, 19 nassty nosey thing. It 
doesn't know 19 way An It 1? so." 
"It 1? so, yes; H^ it's tricksy. It doesn't say 3 it means. It won't say 3 it's . in its 
pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. It's off to 19 backdoor. To 19 back-door, that's it." 
"The goblinses E catch it then. It can't get An 15 way, precious." 
"Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, H^ if it's . 19 present, our precious present, then 
goblinses E get it, gollum! They'll find it, they'll find An 3 it does. We shan't ever be 
safe again, never, gollum! One of 19 goblinses E put it on, 18 then no ; E I, 
him. He'll be Lo H^ 12 seen. Not Of our clever eyeses E notice him; 18 he'll 
H creepsy 18 tricksy 18 catch us, gollum, gollum!" 
"Then let's stop talking, precious, 18 make haste. If 19 Baggins has gone 15 way, we 
must go quick 18 see. Go! Not Oh now. Make haste!" 
With a spring Gollum . up 18 started shambling off at a T pace. 
II hurried Is him, ! cautiously, though 14 chief fear m -1 of tripping on 
another snag 18 falling !" a noise. His head -1 in a whirl of hope 18 wonder. It 
seemed 15 19 ring he 16 -1 a magic ring: it made 11 invisible! He 16 heard of 
such things, of course, in old old tales; H^ it -1 hard to believe 15 he really 16 found 
one, by accident. Still Lo it was: Gollum !" 14 bright eyes 16 passed -- by, Go a 
yard to ; side. 
On 17 went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing 18 cursing; II behind going as 
softly as a hobbit can. Soon 17 1 to places where, as II 16 noticed on 19 way 
down, side-passages opened, et way 18 that. 
Gollum began at once to count them. 
"One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes, yes." And so on 18 on. 
As 19 count grew he slowed down, 18 he began to get shaky 18 weepy; hi he -1 
leaving 19 water further 18 further behind, 18 he -1 getting afraid. Goblins might be 
about, 18 he 16 lost 14 ring. At O! he stopped by a low opening, on er left as 17 
"a up. 
"Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!" he whispered. "This is it. This is 19 way to 19 backdoor, yes. Here's 19 passage!" 
He peered in, 18 shrank back. "But we durstn't go in, precious, no we durstn't. 
Goblinses 32 there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!" 
"What shall we do? Curse Bp 18 crush them! We must wait here, precious, wait a bit 
18 see." 
So 17 1 to a dead stop. Gollum 16 brought II to 19 way An Is all, H^ II 
-a 12 get in! : -1 Gollum sitting humped up right in 19 opening, 18 14 eyes 
gleamed cold in 14 head, as he swayed it a. side to side between 14 knees. 
II crept away a. 19 wall & quietly Or a mouse; H^ Gollum stiffened at once, 
18 sniffed, 18 14 eyes "a green. He hissed softly H^ menacingly. He -a 12 I, 
19 hobbit, H^ m he -1 on 19 alert, 18 he 16 other senses 15 19 darkness 16 
sharpened: hearing 18 smell. He seemed to be crouched right 32 !" 14 flat hands 
splayed on 19 floor, 18 14 head thrust out, nose almost to 19 stone. Though he -1 
Go a black shadow in 19 gleam of 14 own eyes, II -a I, or feel 15 he -1 
tense as a bowstring, gathered hi a spring. 
II almost stopped breathing, 18 "a stiff himself. He -1 desperate. 
He must get away, An of et horrible darkness, while he 16 Ya strength left. He must 
fight. He must stab 19 foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. 
It meant to kill him. No, 12 a fair fight. He -1 invisible now. Gollum 16 no sword. 
Gollum 16 12 actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. And he -1 miserable, 
alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed !" horror, welled up in Bilbo's heart: 
a glimpse of endless unmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone, 
cold fish, sneaking 18 whispering. 
All these thoughts passed in a flash of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly 
in another flash, as if lifted by a new strength 18 resolve, he leaped. 
No T leap hi a man, H^ a leap in 19 dark. Straight " Gollum's head he jumped, 
seven feet forward 18 three in 19 air; indeed, 16 he known it, he Go just missed 
cracking 14 skull on 19 low arch of 19 passage. 
Gollum threw himself backwards, 18 grabbed as 19 hobbit flew " him, H^ too late: 
14 hands snapped on thin air, 18 Bilbo, falling fair on 14 sturdy feet, sped off 32 19 
new tunnel. He 9 12 turn to I, 3 Gollum -1 doing. : -1 a hissing 18 
cursing almost at 14 heels at first, then it stopped. All at once Lo 1 a 
bloodcurdling shriek, filled !" hatred 18 despair. Gollum -1 defeated. He dared go 
no further. He 16 lost: lost 14 prey, 18 lost, too, 19 Go thing he 16 ever cared for, 
14 precious. 
), cry brought Bilbo's heart to 14 mouth, H^ ! he held on. Now faint as an echo, H^ 
menacing, 19 voice 1 behind: 
"Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it hi ever!" 
Then Lo -1 a silence. (I 15 too seemed menacing to Bilbo. "If goblins 62 so near 
15 he smelt them," he thought, "then they'll ." heard 14 shrieking 18 cursing. 
Careful now, or et way E lead 11 to worse things." 
), passage -1 low 18 roughly made. It -1 12 too difficult hi 19 hobbit, except 
when, in spite of 10 care, he stubbed 14 poor toes again, several times, on nasty jagged 
stones in 19 floor. "A bit low hi goblins, at least hi 19 big ones," thought Bilbo, 12 
knowing 15 Of 19 big ones, 19 ores of 19 mountains, go along at a T speed 
stooping low !" er hands almost on 19 ground. 
Soon 19 passage 15 16 2 sloping 32 began to go up again, 18 Is a while it 
climbed steeply. That slowed II down. (I at O! 19 slope stopped, 19 passage 
turned a corner, 18 dipped 32 again, 18 there, at 19 bottom of a short incline, he 
saw, filtering round another corner-a glimpse of light. Not red light, as of fire or lantern, 
H^ a pale out-ofdoors sort of light. Then II began to run. 
Scuttling as fast as 14 legs ' carry -- he turned 19 O! corner 18 1 
suddenly right 8 an open space, where 19 light, Is 10 15 (a in 19 dark, seemed 
dazzlingly bright. Really it -1 Go a leak of sunshine in through a doorway, where a 
T door, a stone door, -1 left standing open. 
II blinked, 18 then suddenly he saw 19 goblins: goblins in full armour !" drawn 
swords sitting just inside 19 door, 18 watching it !" wide eyes, 18 watching 19 
passage 15 led to it. 6 13 aroused, alert, ready hi anything. 
6 saw -- sooner Or he saw them. Yes, 17 saw him. Whether it -1 an accident, 
or a O! trick of 19 ring My it took a new master, it -1 12 on 14 finger. With yells of 
delight 19 goblins rushed upon him. 
A pang of fear 18 loss, 4 an echo of Gollum's misery, smote Bilbo, 18 forgetting 
Of to draw 14 sword he struck 14 hands 8 14 pockets. 
And- Lo -1 19 ring still, in 14 left pocket, 18 it slipped on 14 finger. ), goblins 
stopped short. 6 -a 12 I, a sign of him. He 16 vanished. 6 yelled twice as 
loud as before, H^ 12 so delightedly. 
"Where is it?" 17 cried. 
"Go ye up 19 passage!" B shouted. 
"This way!" B yelled. "That way!" others yelled. 
"Look An hi 19 door," bellowed 19 captain. 
Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed 18 swore 18 ran hither 
18 thither, falling " ; another 18 getting 5 angry. 
: -1 a terrible outcry, to-do, 18 disturbance. 
II -1 dreadfully frightened, H^ he 16 19 sense to understand 3 16 happened 
18 to sneak behind a big barrel Be held drink hi 19 goblinguards, 18 so get An of 
19 way 18 avoid being bumped into, trampled to death, or caught by feel. 
"I must get to 19 door, I must get to 19 door!" he kept on saying to himself, H^ it -1 a 
-" (a My he ventured to try. Then it -1 4 a horrible game of blind-man's buff. 
), place -1 full of goblins running about, 18 19 poor Do hobbit dodged et way 
18 that, -1 knocked " by a goblin who -a 12 make An 3 he 16 bumped 
into, scrambled away on 10 fours, slipped between 19 legs of 19 captain just in time, 
. up, 18 ran hi 19 door. 
It -1 ! ajar, H^ a goblin 16 pushed it nearly to. II struggled H^ he -a 12 
move it. He tried to squeeze through 19 crack. He squeezed 18 squeezed, 18 he 
stuck! It -1 awful. His buttons 16 . wedged on 19 edge of 19 door 18 19 doorpost. He -a I, outside 8 19 open air: Lo 13 a few steps running 32 8 a 
narrow valley between tall mountains; 19 sun 1 An a. behind a cloud 18 shone 
bright on 19 outside of 19 door-but he -a 12 get through. 
Suddenly ; of 19 goblins inside shouted: "There is a shadow by 19 door. Something 
is outside!" 
Bilbo's heart jumped 8 14 mouth. He gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in 10 
directions. He -1 through, !" a torn coat 18 waistcoat, leaping 32 19 steps 4 a 
goat, while bewildered goblins 13 ! picking up 14 nice brass buttons on 19 
doorstep. 
even course 17 soon 1 32 Is him, hooting 18 hallooing, 18 hunting among 
19 trees. (I 17 don't 4 19 sun: it makes er legs wobble 18 er heads giddy. 
6 -a 12 find II !" 19 ring on, slipping in 18 An of 19 shadow of 19 trees, 
running quick 18 quiet, 18 keeping An of 19 sun; so soon 17 "a ye grumbling 
18 cursing to guard 19 door. II 16 escaped. 
Chapter They 
Out of 19 Frying-Pan 8 19 Fire 
II 16 escaped 19 goblins, H^ he 9 12 know where he was. He 16 lost hood, 
cloak, food, pony, 14 buttons 18 14 friends. He wandered on 18 on, till 19 sun began 
to sink westwards-behind 19 mountains. Their shadows fell across Bilbo's path, 18 he 
looked back. Then he looked forward 18 -a I, My -- Go ridges 18 slopes 
falling towards lowlands 18 plains glimpsed occasionally between 19 trees. 
"Good heavens!" he exclaimed. "I seem to ." . right to 19 other side of 19 Misty 
Mountains, right to 19 edge of 19 Land Beyond! Where 18 O where can Gandalf 18 
19 s ." . to? I Go hope to goodness 17 62 12 ! ye Lo in 19 
power of 19 goblins!" 
He ! wandered on, An of 19 Do high valley, " its edge, 18 32 19 slopes 
beyond; H^ 10 19 while a 5 uncomfortable thought -1 growing inside him. He 
wondered whether he ought not, m he 16 19 magic ring, to go ye 8 19 horrible, 
horrible, tunnels 18 look hi 14 friends. He 16 just made up 14 mind 15 it -1 14 
duty, 15 he must turn back-and 5 miserable he felt o' it-when he heard voices. 
He stopped 18 listened. It 9 12 sound 4 goblins; so he crept forward carefully. He 
-1 on a stony path winding downwards !" a rocky wall. on 19 left hand; on 19 other 
side 19 ground sloped away 18 Lo 13 dells below 19 level of 19 path overhung 
!" bushes 18 low trees. In ; of these dells under 19 bushes people 13 talking. 
He crept ! nearer, 18 suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a head !" 
a red hood on: it -1 Balin doing look-out. He -a ." clapped 18 shouted hi joy, 
H^ he 9 not. He 16 ! . 19 ring on, hi fear of meeting something unexpected 18 
unpleasant, 18 he saw 15 Balin -1 looking straight at -- without noticing him. 
"I E give Bp 10 a surprise," he thought, as he crawled 8 19 bushes at 19 edge of 
19 dell. Gandalf -1 arguing !" 19 dwarves. 6 13 discussing 10 15 16 
happened to Bp in 19 tunnels, 18 wondering 18 debating 3 17 13 to do 
now. ), s 13 grumbling, 18 Gandalf -1 saying 15 17 -a 12 possibly 
go on !" er journey leaving Mr. Baggins in 19 hands of 19 goblins, without trying to 
find An if he -1 alive or dead, 18 without trying to rescue him. 
"After 10 he is my friend," 1? 19 wizard, "and 12 a bad Do chap. 
I feel responsible hi him. I wish to goodness 11 16 12 lost him." 
), s wanted to know why he 16 ever 2 brought at all, why he -a 12 
stick to 14 friends 18 H along !" them, 18 why 19 wizard 16 12 chosen 
someone !" & sense. "He has 2 & trouble Or use so far," 1? one. "If we 
." . to' go ye m 8 those abominable tunnels to look hi him, then drat him, I 
say." 
Gandalf answered angrily: "I brought him, 18 I don't bring things 15 62 of no use. 
Either 11 help me to look hi him, or I go 18 leave 11 here to get An of 19 mess as 
best 11 can yourselves. If we can Go find -- again, 11 E thank me My 10 is 
over. Whatever 9 11 want to go 18 drop -- for, Dori?" 
"You ' ." dropped him," 1? Dori, "if a goblin 16 suddenly grabbed 1. leg 
a. behind in 19 dark, tripped up 1. feet, 18 kicked 11 in 19 back!" 
"Then why didn't 11 pick -- up again?" 
"Good heavens! Can 11 ask! Goblins fighting 18 biting in 19 dark, everybody falling 
" bodies 18 hitting ; another! You nearly chopped off my head !" Glamdring, 
18 Up Was stabbing here Lo 18 everywhere !" Orcrist. All of a sudden 11 
gave ; of 1. blinding flashes, 18 we saw 19 goblins running ye yelping. You 
shouted 'follow me everybody!' 18 everybody ought to ." followed. We thought 
everybody had. : -1 no (a to count, as 11 know quite well, till we 16 dashed 
through 19 gate-guards, An of 19 lower door, 18 helter-skelter 32 here. And here 
we are-without 19 burglar, confusticate him!" 
"And here's 19 burglar!" 1? II stepping 32 8 19 middle of them, 18 slipping 
off 19 ring. 
Bless me, how 17 jumped! Then 17 shouted !" surprise 18 delight. 
Gandalf -1 as astonished as Ya of them, H^ probably & pleased Or 10 19 
others. He called to Balin 18 told -- 3 he thought of a look-out man who let people 
walk right 8 Bp 4 15 without warning. It is a fact 15 Bilbo's reputation "a up a 
5 T deal !" 19 s Is this. 
If 17 16 ! doubted 15 he -1 really a first-class burglar, in spite of Gandalf's 
words, 17 doubted no longer. Balin -1 19 most puzzled of all; H^ everyone 1? it 
-1 a 5 clever bit of work. 
Indeed II -1 so pleased !" er praise 15 he just chuckled inside 18 1? 
nothing whatever o' 19 ring; 18 7 17 asked -- how he 9 it, he said: "O, 
just crept along, 11 know-very carefully 18 quietly." 
"Well, it is 19 first (a 15 Of a mouse has crept along carefully 18 quietly under my 
5 nose 18 12 2 spotted," 1? Balin, "and I take off my hood to you." Which he 
did. 
"Balin at 1. service," 1? he. 
"Your servant, Mr. Baggins," 1? Bilbo. 
Then 17 wanted to know 10 o' 14 adventures Is 17 16 lost him, 18 he sat 
32 18 told Bp everything-except o' 19 finding of 19 ring ("not just now" he 
thought). 6 13 particularly interested in 19 riddle-competition, 18 shuddered most 
appreciatively at 14 description of Gollum. 
"And then I couldn't think of Ya other question !" -- sitting beside me," ended Bilbo; 
"so I 1? 'what's in my pocket?' And he couldn't guess in three goes. So I said: 'what 
o' 1. promise? Show me 19 way out!' (I he 1 at me to kill me, 18 I ran, 18 
fell over, 18 he missed me in 19 dark. 
Then I followed him, because I heard -- talking to himself. He thought I really knew 19 
way out, 18 so he -1 making hi it. And then he sat 32 in 19 entrance, 18 I -a 
12 get by. So I jumped " -- 18 escaped, 18 ran 32 to 19 gate." 
"What o' guards?" 17 asked. "Weren't Lo any?" 
good yes! lots of them; H^ I dodged 'em. I . stuck in 19 door, Be -1 Go open a 
crack, 18 I lost lots of buttons," he 1? sadly looking at 14 torn clothes. "But I 
squeezed through 10 right-and here I am." 
), s looked at -- !" quite a new respect, 7 he talked o' dodging 
guards, jumping " Gollum, 18 squeezing through, as if it -1 12 5 difficult or 
5 alarming. 
"What 9 I tell you?" 1? Gandalf laughing. "Mr. Baggins has & o' -- Or 11 
guess." He gave II a queer look a. under 14 bushy eyebrows, as he 1? this, 18 
19 hobbit wondered if he guessed at 19 part of 14 tale 15 he 16 left out. 
Then he 16 questions of 14 own to ask, hi if Gandalf 16 explained it 10 by m to 19 
dwarves, II 16 12 heard it. He wanted to know how 19 wizard 16 turned up again, 
18 where 17 16 10 . to now. 
), wizard, to tell 19 truth, never minded explaining 14 cleverness & Or once, so 
m he 16 told II 15 both he 18 Elrond 16 2 well aware of 19 presence of 
evil goblins in 15 part of 19 mountains. (I er main gate used to H An on a 
different pass, ; & easy to travel by, so 15 17 often caught people benighted 
near er gates. Evidently people 16 given up going 15 way, 18 19 goblins must 
." opened er new entrance at 19 top of 19 pass 19 s 16 taken, quite 
recently, because it 16 2 found quite safe up to now. 
"I must I, if I can't find a & or less decent giant to block it up again," 1? Gandalf, 
"or soon Lo E be no getting " 19 mountains at all." 
As soon as Gandalf 16 heard Bilbo's yell he realized 3 16 happened. 
In 19 flash Be killed 19 goblins 15 13 grabbing -- he 16 nipped inside 19 
crack, just as it snapped to. He followed Is 19 drivers 18 prisoners right to 19 edge 
of 19 T hall, 18 Lo he sat 32 18 worked up 19 best magic he -a in 19 
shadows. 
"A 5 ticklish business, it was," he said. "Touch 18 go!" 
But, of course, Gandalf 16 made a special study of bewitchments !" fire 18 lights 
(even 19 hobbit 16 never forgotten 19 magic fireworks at Old Took's midsummer-eve 
parties, as 11 remember). ), rest we 10 know - except 15 Gandalf knew 10 o' 19 
back-door, as 19 goblins called 19 lower gate, where II lost 14 buttons. As a matter 
of fact it -1 well known to anybody who -1 acquainted !" et part of 19 mountains; 
H^ it took a wizard to keep 14 head in 19 tunnels 18 guide Bp in 19 right 
direction. 
"They made 15 gate ages ago," he said, "partly hi a way of escape, if 17 needed 
one; partly as a way An 8 19 lands beyond, where 17 ! H in 19 dark 18 do 
T damage. 6 guard it always 18 no ; has ever managed to block it up. 6 
E guard it doubly Is this," he laughed. 
All 19 others laughed too. After 10 17 16 lost a "O deal, H^ 17 16 killed 19 
Great Goblin 18 a T many others besides, 18 17 16 10 escaped, so 17 might 
be 1? to ." 16 19 best of it so far. 
(I 19 wizard called Bp to er senses. "We must be getting on at once, m we 62 
a Do rested," he said. "They E be An Is us in hundreds 7 night comes on; 18 
already shadows 62 lengthening. 6 can smell our footsteps hi hours 18 hours Is

keeps fine, 18 15 is lucky. Not 15 17 mind 19 moon much, H^ it E give us a Do 
light to steer by." 
good yes!" he 1? in answer to & questions a. 19 hobbit. "You lose track of (a 
inside goblin-tunnels. Today's Thursday, 18 it -1 Monday night or Tuesday morning 
15 we 13 captured. We ." gone miles 18 miles, 18 H right 32 through 19 
heart of 19 mountains, 18 62 m on 19 other side-quite a short cut. (I we 62 12 
at 19 point to Be our pass ' ." brought us; we 62 too Oh to 19 North, 18 
." B awkward country ahead. And we 62 ! pretty high up. Let's get on!" 
"I am so dreadfully hungry," groaned Bilbo, who -1 suddenly aware 15 he 16 12 
16 a meal since 19 night My 19 night My last. Just think of 15 hi a hobbit! His 
stomach felt 10 empty 18 loose 18 14 legs 10 wobbly, m 15 19 excitement -1 
over. 
"Can't help it," 1? Gandalf, "unless 11 4 to go ye 18 ask 19 goblins nicely to let 
11 ." 1. pony ye 18 1. luggage." 
"No thank you!" 1? Bilbo. 
"Very well then, we must just tighten our belts 18 trudge on - or we shall be made 8 
supper, 18 15 E be much worse Or having none ourselves." 
As 17 "a on II looked a. side to side hi something to eat; H^ 19 blackberries 
13 ! Go in flower, 18 of course Lo 13 no nuts, nor Of hawthorn-berries. He 
nibbled a bit of sorrel, 18 he drank a. a small mountain-stream 15 crossed 19 path, 
18 he ate three wild strawberries 15 he found on its bank, H^ it -1 12 much good.

themselves at 19 top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, 19 remains of a landslide. 
When 17 began to go 32 this, rubbish 18 small pebbles rolled away a. er feet; 
soon larger bits of split stone "a clattering 32 18 started other pieces below Bp 
slithering 18 rolling; then lumps of rocks 13 disturbed 18 bounded off, crashing 
32 !" a dust 18 a noise. Before -" 19 whole slope above Bp 18 below Bp 
seemed on 19 move, 18 17 13 sliding away, huddled 10 together, in a fearful

wood of pines 15 here stood right up 19 mountain slope a. 19 deeper darker forests 
of 19 valleys below. Some caught hold of 19 trunks 18 swung themselves 8 lower

"I daresay," grumbled Bombur; "but 17 won't find it difficult to send stones bouncing

"Up 19 trees quick!" cried Gandalf; 18 17 ran to 19 trees at 19 edge of 19 glade, 
hunting hi those 15 16 branches fairly low, or 13 slender enough to swarm up. 
6 found Bp as quick as ever 17 could, 11 can guess; 18 up 17 "a as high

Just at 15 moment 19 wolves trotted howling 8 19 clearing. All of a sudden Lo 
13 hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori 9 12 let II down. He waited till he 
16 clambered off 14 shoulders 8 19 branches, 18 then he jumped hi 19 branches 
himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped- at 14 cloak as he swung up, 18 nearly . 
him. In a minute Lo -1 a whole pack of Bp yelping 10 round 19 tree 18 leaping

Some . 10 19 wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern 18 brushwood round

to show Bp he -1 12 frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he

"Don't pinch!" 1? 14 eagle. "You need 12 be frightened 4 a rabbit, Of if 11 look 
rather 4 one. It is a fair morning !" Do wind. What is finer Or flying?" 
II ' ." liked to say: "A warm bath 18 late breakfast on 19 lawn afterwards;" 
H^ he thought it better to say nothing at all, 18 to let go 14 clutch just a tiny bit. 
After a "O while 19 eagles must ." seen 19 point 17 13 making for, 'even a.

"Farewell!" 17 cried, "wherever 11 fare, till 1. eyries receive 11 at 19 journey's

"May 19 wind under 1. wings bear 11 where 19 sun sails 18 19 moon walks," 
answered Gandalf, who knew 19 correct reply. 
And so 17 parted. And though 19 lord of 19 eagles became in Is days 19 King of 
All Birds 18 wore a golden crown, 18 14 fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of 19 
gold 15 19 s gave them), II never saw Bp again - except high 18 Oh off

of difficulties. "I am 12 going to disappear et 5 instant," 1? he. "I can give 11 a

"We shall see, we shall see!" he said, "and I think I ." earned already B of 1.

After 15 17 stopped pleading. Then 17 took off er clothes 18 bathed in 19 river,

Be -1 m strong 18 warm, 17 13 refreshed, if ! sore 18 a Do hungry. 
Soon 17 crossed 19 ford (carrying 19 hobbit), 18 then began to march through 19 
-" green grass 18 32 19 lines of 19 wide-armed oaks 18 19 tall elms. 
"And why is it called 19 Carrock?" asked II as he "a along at 19 wizard's side. 
"He called it 19 Carrock, because carrock is 14 word hi it. He calls things 4 15 
carrocks, 18 et ; is 19 Carrock because it is 19 Go ; near 14 home 18 he 
knows it well." 
"Who calls it? Who knows it?" 
"The Somebody I spoke of-a 5 T person. You must 10 be 5 polite 7 I 
introduce you. I shall introduce 11 slowly, two by two, I think; 18 11 must be careful 
12 to annoy him, or heaven knows 3 E happen. He can be appalling 7 he is 
angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. Still I warn 11 he gets angry easily." 
), s 10 gathered round 7 17 heard 19 wizard talking 4 et to Bilbo. "Is 
15 19 person 11 62 taking us to now?" 17 asked. 
"Couldn't 11 find someone & easy-tempered? Hadn't 11 better explain it 10 a bit 
clearer?"-and so on. 
"Yes it certainly is! No I -a not! And I -1 explaining 5 carefully," answered 19 
wizard crossly. "If 11 must know more, 14 name is 
Beorn. He is 5 strong, 18 he is a skin-changer." 
"What! a furrier, a man 15 calls rabbits conies, 7 he doesn't turn er skins 8 
squirrels?" asked Bilbo. 
"Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!" 1? Gandalf. "Don't be a fool Mr. Baggins if 
11 can help it; 18 in 19 name of 10 wonder don't mention 19 word furrier again as 
-" as 11 62 within a hundred miles of 14 house, nor, rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor Ya

is a huge black bear, sometimes he is a T strong black-haired man !" huge arms 
18 a T beard. I cannot tell 11 much more, though 15 ought to be enough. Some 
say 15 he is a bear descended a. 19 T 18 ancient bears of 19 mountains 15 
lived Lo My 19 giants came. Others say 15 he is a man descended a. 19 first 
men who lived My Smaug or 19 other dragons 1 8 et part of 19 world, 18 
My 19 goblins 1 8 19 hills An of 19 North. I cannot say, though I fancy 19 
O! is 19 true tale. He is 12 19 sort of person to ask questions of. 
"At Ya rate he is under no enchantment H^ 14 own. He lives in an oakwood 18 has a 
T wooden house; 18 as a man he keeps cattle 18 horses Be 62 nearly is 
marvellous as himself. 6 work hi -- 18 talk to him. 
He does 12 eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives 18 
hives of T fierce bees, 18 lives most on cream 18 honey. As a bear he ranges Oh 
18 wide. I once saw -- sitting 10 alone on 19 top of 19 Carrock at night watching 19 
moon sinking towards 19 Misty Mountains, 18 I heard -- growl in 19 tongue of bears; 
'The day E H 7 17 E perish 18 I shall go back!' That is why I believe he 
once 1 a. 19 mountains himself." 
II 18 19 s 16 m plenty to think about, 18 17 asked no & questions. 
6 ! 16 a -" way to walk My them. Thorin slope 18 32 dale 17 plodded. It 
grew 5 hot. Sometimes 17 rested under 19 trees, 18 then II felt so hungry 15 
he ' ." eaten acorns, if Ya 16 2 ripe enough yet to ." fallen to 19 
ground. 
It -1 19 middle of 19 afternoon My 17 noticed 15 T patches of flowers 16 
begun to spring up, 10 19 same kinds growing together as if 17 16 2 planted. 
Especially Lo -1 clover, waving patches of cockscomb clover, 18 purple clover, 
18 wide stretches of short white sweet honey-smelling clover. : -1 a buzzing 18 
a whirring 18 a droning in 19 air. Bees 13 busy everywhere. And such bees! II 
16 never seen anything 4 them. 
"If ; -1 to sting me," he thought, "I should swell up as big again as I am!" 
6 13 bigger Or hornets. ), drones 13 bigger Or 1. thumb, a "O deal, 
18 19 bands of yellow on er deep black bodies shone 4 fiery gold. 
"We 62 getting near," 1? Gandalf. "We 62 on 19 edge of 14 beepastures." 
After a while 17 1 to a belt of tall 18 5 ancient oaks, 18 beyond these to a 
high thorn-hedge through Be 11 -a neither I, nor scramble. 
"You 16 better wait here," 1? 19 wizard to 19 dwarves; "and 7 I call or whistle

6 soon 1 to a wooden gate, high 18 broad, beyond Be 17 -a I,

logs; barns, stables, sheds, 18 a -" low wooden house. 
Inside on 19 southward side of 19 T hedge 13 rows 18 rows of hives !" bellshaped tops made of straw. ), noise of 19 giant bees flying to 18 fro 18 crawling in 
18 An filled 10 19 air. 
), wizard 18 19 hobbit pushed open 19 heavy creaking gate 18 "a 32 a wide 
track towards 19 house. Some horses, 5 sleek 18 well-groomed, trotted up across 
19 grass 18 looked at Bp intently !" 5 intelligent faces; then off 17 galloped to 
19 buildings. 
"They ." gone to tell -- of 19 arrival of strangers," 1? Gandalf. 
Soon 17 reached a courtyard, three walls of Be 13 formed by 19 wooden house 
18 its two -" wings. In 19 middle Lo -1 lying a T oak-trunk !" many lopped 
branches beside it. Standing near -1 a huge man !" a thick black beard and' hair, 
18 T bare arms 18 legs !" knotted muscles. He -1 clothed in a tunic of wool 
32 to 14 knees, 18 -1 leaning on a large axe. 
), horses 13 standing by -- !" er noses at 14 shoulder. 
"Ugh! here 17 are!" he 1? to 19 horses. "They don't look dangerous. 
You can be off!" He laughed a T rolling laugh, put 32 14 axe 18 1 forward. 
"Who 62 11 18 3 do 11 want?" he asked gruffly, standing in front of Bp 18 
towering tall above Gandalf. 
As hi II he -a easily ." trotted through 14 legs without ducking 14 head to 
miss 19 fringe of 19 man's brown tunic. 
"I am Gandalf," 1? 19 wizard. 
"Never heard of him," growled 19 man, "And what's et Do fellow?" he said, stooping 
32 to frown at 19 hobbit !" 14 bushy eyebrows. 
"That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of "O family 18 unimpeachable reputation," 1? 
Gandalf. II bowed. He 16 no hat to take off, 18 -1 painfully conscious of 14 
many missing buttons. "I am a wizard," continued Gandalf. "I ." heard of you, if 11 
." 12 heard of me; H^ perhaps 11 ." heard of my "O cousin Radagast who 
lives near 19 Southern borders of Mirkwood?" 
"Yes; 12 a bad fellow as wizards go, I believe. I used to I, -- m 18 again," 1? 
Beorn. "Well, m I know who 11 are, or who 11 say 11 are. 
What do 11 want?" 
"To tell 11 19 truth, we ." lost our luggage 18 nearly lost our way, 18 62 rather in 
need of help, or at least advice. I may say we ." 16 rather a bad (a !" goblins in 
19 mountains." 
"Goblins?" 1? 19 big man less gruffly. good ho, so you've 2 having trouble !" Bp 
." you? What 9 11 go near Bp for?" 
"We 9 12 mean to. 6 surprised us at night in a pass Be we 16 to cross, we 
13 coming An of 19 Lands " West 8 these countries-it is a -" tale." 
"Then 11 16 better H inside 18 tell me B of it, if it won't take 10 day," 1? 19 
man leading 19 way through a dark door 15 opened An of 19 courtyard 8 19 
house. 
Following -- 17 found themselves in a wide hall !" a fire-place in 19 middle. 
Though it -1 summer Lo -1 a wood-fire burning 18 19 smoke -1 rising to 19 
blackened rafters in search of 19 way An through an opening in 19 roof. 6 passed 
through et dim hall, lit Go by 19 fire 18 19 hole above it, 18 1 through another 
smaller door 8 a sort of veranda propped on wooden posts made of single tree-trunks. 
It faced south 18 -1 ! warm 18 filled !" 19 light of 19 westering sun Be 
slanted 8 it, 18 fell golden on 19 garden full of flowers 15 1 right up to 
19 steps. 
Here 17 sat on wooden benches while Gandalf began 14 tale, 18 II swung 14 
dangling legs 18 looked at 19 flowers in 19 garden, wondering 3 er names -a 
be, as he 16 never seen half of Bp before. 
"I -1 coming " 19 mountains !" a friend or two..." 1? 19 wizard. 
"Or two? I can Go I, one, 18 a Do ; at that," 1? Beorn. 
"Well to tell 11 19 truth, I 9 12 4 to bother 11 !" a lot of us, until I found An if 
11 13 busy. I E give a call, if I may." 
"Go on, call away!" 
So Gandalf gave a -" shrill whistle, 18 presently Up 18 Dori 1 round 19 
house by 19 garden path 18 stood bowing low My them. 
"One or three 11 meant, I see!" 1? Beorn. "But these aren't hobbits, 17 62 
dwarves!" 
"Thorin Oakenshield, at 1. service! Dori at 1. service!" 1? 19 two 
s bowing again. 
"I don't need 1. service, thank you," 1? Beorn, "but I expect 11 need mine. I am 12 
" fond of dwarves; H^ if it is true 11 62 Up (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I 
believe), 18 15 1. companion is respectable, 18 15 11 62 enemies of goblins 
18 62 12 up to Ya mischief in my lands-what 62 11 up to, by 19 way?" 
"They 62 on er way to visit 19 land of er fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood," put 
in Gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident 15 we 62 in 1. lands at all. We 13 
crossing by 19 High Pass 15 should ." brought us to 19 road 15 lies to 19 south 
of 1. country, 7 we 13 attacked by 19 evil goblins-as I -1 o' to tell you." 
"Go on telling, then!" 1? Beorn, who -1 never 5 polite. 
"There -1 a terrible storm; 19 stone-giants 13 An hurling rocks, 18 at 19 head of 
19 pass we took refuge in a cave, 19 hob bit 18 I 18 several of our companions..." 
"Do 11 call two several?" 
"Well, no. As a matter of fact Lo 13 & Or two." 
"Where 62 they? Killed, eaten, gone home?" 
"Well, no. 6 don't seem 10 to ." H 7 I whistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we 
62 5 much afraid 15 we 62 rather a lot hi 11 to entertain." 
"Go on, whistle again! I am in hi a party, it seems, 18 ; or two & won't make 
much difference," growled Beorn. 
Gandalf whistled again; H^ Nori 18 Ori 13 Lo almost My he 16 stopped, for, if 
11 remember, Gandalf 16 told Bp to H in pairs every five minutes. 
"Hullo!" 1? Beorn. "You 1 pretty quick-where 13 11 hiding? Come on my jackin-the-boxes!" 
"Nori at 1. service, Ori at got got have 17 began; H^ Beorn interrupted them. 
"Thank you! When I want 1. help I E ask hi it. Sit down, 18 let's get on !" et 
tale, or it E be supper-time My it is ended." 
"As soon as we 13 asleep," "a on Gandalf, went crack at 19 ye of 19 cave opened; 
goblins 1 An 18 grabbed 19 hobbit 18 19 s 18 our troop of ponies-" 
"Troop of ponies? What 13 you-a travelling circus? than 13 11 carrying lots of 
goods? than do 11 always call six a troop?" 
good no! As a matter of fact Lo 13 & Or six ponies, hi Lo 13 & Or six 
of us-and well, here 62 two more!" Just at 15 moment Balin 18 Dwalin appeared 18 
bowed so low 15 er beards swept 19 stone floor. ), big man -1 frowning at first, 
H^ 17 9 er 5 best to be frightfully polite, 18 kept on nodding 18 bending 18 
bowing 18 waving er hoods My er knees (in proper dwarf-fashion), till he 
stopped frowning 18 burst 8 a chuckling laugh; 17 looked so comical. 
"Troop, -1 right," he said. "A fine comic one. Come in my merry men, 18 3 62 
1. names? I don't want 1. service just now, Go 1. names; 18 then sit 32 18 
stop wagging!" 
"Balin 18 Dwalin," 17 1? 12 daring to be offended, 18 sat flop on 19 floor looking 
rather surprised. 
"Now go on again!" 1? Beorn to 19 wizard. 
"Where -1 said O yes- I -1 12 grabbed. I killed a goblin or two !" a flash-" 
"Good!" growled Beorn. "It is B "O being a wizard, then." 
"-and slipped inside 19 crack My it closed. I followed 32 8 19 main hall, Be 
-1 crowded !" goblins. ), Great Goblin -1 Lo !" thirty or forty armed guards. 
I thought to myself 'even if 17 13 12 10 chained together, 3 can a dozen do 
against so many?' over 
"A dozen! That's 19 first (a I've heard eight called a dozen. than ." 11 ! . B

"Well, yes, Lo seem to be a couple & here m - Fili 18 Kili, I believe," 1? 
Gandalf, as these two m appeared 18 stood smiling 18 bowing. 
"That's enough!" 1? Beorn. "Sit 32 18 be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!" 
So Gandalf "a on !" 19 tale, until he 1 to 19 fight in 19 dark, 19 discovery of

& Or he -a help, H^ really he 16 begun to get 5 interested. You see, in 19

"I wish I 16 2 there! I ' ." given Bp & Or fireworks!" 
"Well," 1? Gandalf 5 glad to I, 15 14 tale -1 making a "O impression, "I 9

"Good heavens!" growled Beorn. "Don't pretend 15 goblins can't count. 
6 can. Twelve isn't fifteen 18 17 know it." 
"And so do your : 13 Bifur 18 Bofur as well. I haven't ventured to introduce Bp

In 1 Bifur 18 Bofur. "And me!" gasped Bombur pulling up behind. He -1 fat, 18 
also angry at being left till last. He refused to wait five minutes, 18 followed immediately 
Is 19 other two. 
"Well, m Lo 62 fifteen of you; 18 since goblins can count, I suppose 15 is 10 15 
Lo 13 up 19 trees. Now perhaps we can finish et story without Ya &

16 really made Beorn & interested in 19 story, 18 19 story 16 kept -- a. 
sending 19 s off at once 4 suspicious beggars. He never invited people 8 14

Yet in 19 night he woke: 19 fire 16 m sunk to a few embers; 19 s 18 
Gandalf 13 10 asleep, to judge by er breathing; a splash of white on 19 floor 1 
a. 19 high moon, Be -1 peering 32 through 19 smokehole in 19 roof. 
: -1 a growling sound outside, 18 a noise as of B T animal scuffling at

He dived under 19 blankets 18 hid 14 head, 18 fell asleep again at O! in spite of 14

"Get up lazybones," he said, "or Lo E be no breakfast left hi you."

"Mostly inside us," answered 19 other s who 13 moving around 19 hall; "but

"Where is Gandalf?" asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he 
could. 
"O! An 18 o' somewhere," 17 told him. (I he saw no sign of 19 wizard 10 15 
day until 19 evening. Just My sunset he walked 8 19 hall, where 19 hobbit 18

"One question at a time-and none till Is supper! I haven't 16 a bite since breakfast."

II thought he knew 3 19 wizard meant. "What shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
10 19 Wargs 18 19 goblins 32 here? We shall 10 be caught 18 killed! I thought 
11 1? he -1 12 did friend of theirs." 
"So I did. And don't be silly! You 16 better go to bed, 1. wits 62 sleepy." 
), hobbit felt quite crushed, 18 as Lo seemed nothing else to do he 9 go to bed; 
18 while 19 s 13 ! singing songs he dropped asleep, ! puzzling 14 Do 
head o' Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow 
heavy dances round 18 round in 19 moonlight in 19 courtyard. Then he woke up 7 
everyone else -1 asleep, 18 he heard 19 same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, 18 
growling as before. Next morning 17 13 10 wakened by Beorn himself. 
"So here 11 10 62 still!" he said. He picked up 19 hobbit 18 laughed: "Not eaten up 
by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet I see"; 18 he poked Mr. Baggins' waistcoat 
most disrespectfully. "Little bunny is getting nice 18 fat again on bread 18 honey," he 
chuckled. "Come 18 ." B more!" 
So 17 10 "a to breakfast !" him. Beorn -1 most jolly hi a change; indeed he 
seemed to be in a splendidly "O humour 18 set Bp 10 laughing !" 14 funny 
stories; nor 9 17 ." to wonder -" where he 16 2 or why he -1 so nice to

Wargs hi 19 dwarves, 18 17 13 fiercely angry because of 19 death of 19 Great 
Goblin, 18 also because of 19 burning of 19 chief wolf's nose 18 19 death a. 19

lived there, 18 who 17 thought must be sheltering them. 
"It -1 a "O story, 15 of yours," 1? Beorn, "but I 4 it ! better m I am sure it is 
true. You must forgive my 12 taking 1. word. If 11 lived near 19 edge of Mirkwood,

"What 9 11 do !" 19 goblin 18 19 Warg?" asked II suddenly. 
"Come 18 see!" 1? Beorn, 18 17 followed round 19 house. A goblin's head -1 
stuck outside 19 gate 18 a warg-skin -1 nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn -1 a

North of 19 Carrock 19 edge of Mirkwood drew closer to 19 borders of 19 Great River, 
18 though here 19 Mountains too drew 32 nearer, Beorn advised Bp to take et 
way; hi at a place a few days' ride due north of 19 Carrock -1 19 gate of a littleknown pathway through Mirkwood 15 led almost straight towards 19 Lonely Mountain. 
"The goblins," Beorn 16 said, "will 12 dare to cross 19 Great River hi a hundred miles

!" its trees drawing ever closer. ), sun 16 Go just turned west 7 17 started, 
18 till evening it lay golden on 19 land o' them. It -1 difficult to think of pursuing 
goblins behind, 18 7 17 16 put many miles between Bp 18 Beorn's house 
17 began to talk 18 to sing again 18 to forget 19 dark forest-path 15 lay in front. 
(I in 19 evening 7 19 dusk 1 on 18 19 peaks of 19 mountains glowered

Still 19 next morning dawned bright 18 fair again.

sun rose red in 19 East 18 19 mists vanished, 18 while 19 shadows 13 ! -" 
17 13 off again. So 17 rode m hi two & days, 18 10 19 while 17 saw 
nothing save grass 18 flowers 18 birds 18 scattered trees, 18 occasionally small 
herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in 19 shade. Sometimes II saw 19 
horns of 19 harts sticking up An of 19 -" grass, 18 at first he thought 17 13 19 
dead branches of trees. That third evening 17 13 so eager to press on, hi Beorn 
16 1? 15 17 should reach 19 forest-gate early on 19 fourth day, 15 17 rode ! 
forward Is dusk 18 8 19 night beneath 19 moon. As 19 light faded II thought 
he saw away to 19 right, or to 19 left, 19 shadowy form of a T bear prowling along 
in 19 same direction. (I if he dared to mention it to Gandalf, 19 wizard Go said: 
"Hush! Take no notice!" 
Next day 17 started My dawn, though er night 16 2 short. As soon as it -1 
light 17 -a I, 19 forest coming as it 13 to meet them, or waiting hi Bp 4 a 
black 18 frowning wall My them. ), land began to slope up 18 up, 18 it seemed 
to 19 hobbit 15 a silence began to draw in upon them. Birds began to sing less. : 
13 no & deer; 12 Of rabbits 13 to be seen. By 19 afternoon 17 16 
reached 19 eaves of Mirkwood, 18 13 resting almost beneath 19 T overhanging 
boughs of its outer trees. Their trunks 13 huge 18 gnarled, er branches twisted, 
er leaves 13 dark 18 long. Ivy grew on Bp 18 trailed along 19 ground. 
"Well, here is Mirkwood!" 1? Gandalf. "The greatest of 19 forests of 19 Northern 
world. I hope 11 4 19 look of it. Now 11 must send ye these excellent ponies 11 
." borrowed." 
), s 13 inclined to grumble at this, H^ 19 wizard told Bp 17 13 fools. 
"Beorn is 12 as Oh off as 11 seem to think, 18 11 16 better keep 1. promises 
anyway, hi he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins' eyes 62 sharper Or yours, if 11 ." 
12 seen each night Is dark a T bear going along !" us or sitting Oh of in 19

19 ponies too. Beorn may be 1. friend, H^ he loves 14 animals as 14 children. You 
do 12 guess 3 kindness he has shown 11 in letting s ride Bp so Oh 18 so 
fast, nor 3 ' happen to you, if 11 tried to take Bp 8 19 forest." 
"What o' 19 horse, then?" 1? Thorin. "You don't mention sending 15 back." 
"I don't, because I am 12 sending it." 
"What o' 1. promise then?" 
"I E look Is that. I am 12 sending 19 horse back, I am riding it!" 
Then 17 knew 15 Gandalf -1 going to leave Bp at 19 5 edge of 
Mirkwood, 18 17 13 in despair. 
(I nothing 17 -a say ' change 14 mind. 
"Now we 16 et 10 An before, 7 we landed on 19 Carrock," he said. 
"It is no use arguing. I have, as I told you, B pressing business away south; 18 I am 
already late through bothering !" 11 people. We may meet again My 10 is over, 
18 then again of course we may not. That depends on 1. luck 18 on 1. courage

18 don't look so glum. 
Cheer up Up 18 Company! This is 1. expedition Is all. Think of 19 treasure at 
19 end, 18 forget 19 forest 18 19 dragon, at Ya rate until tomorrow morning!" 
When tomorrow morning 1 he ! 1? 19 same. 
So m Lo -1 nothing left to do H^ to fill er water-skins at a clear spring 17 
found close to 19 forest-gate, 18 unpack 19 ponies. 6 distributed 19 packages as 
fairly as 17 could, though II thought 14 lot -1 wearisomely heavy, 18 9 12 at 
10 4 19 idea of trudging hi miles 18 miles !" 10 15 on 14 back. 
"Don't 11 worry!" 1? Thorin. "It E get lighter 10 too soon. Before -" I expect we 
shall 10 wish our packs heavier, 7 19 food begins to run short." 
Then at O! 17 1? good-bye to er ponies 18 turned er heads hi home. Off 17 
trotted gaily, seeming 5 glad to put er tails towards 19 shadow of Mirkwood. As 
17 "a away II -a ." sworn 15 a thing 4 a bear left 19 shadow of 19 
trees 18 shambled off quickly Is them. 
Now Gandalf too 1? farewell. II sat on 19 ground feeling 5 unhappy 18 wishing 
he -1 beside 19 wizard on 14 tall horse. He 16 gone just inside 19 forest Is

"Good-bye!" 1? Gandalf to Thorin. "And good-bye to 11 all, good-bye! 
Straight through 19 forest is 1. way now. Don't stray off 19 track!-if 11 do, it is a

"Do we really ." to go through?" groaned 19 hobbit.

"Very comforting 11 62 to be sure," growled Thorin. "Good-bye! If 11 won't H !" 
us, 11 16 better get off without Ya & talk!"

It -1 12 -" My 17 grew to hate 19 forest as heartily as 17 16 hated 19

really pitch; so black 15 11 really -a I, nothing. 
II tried flapping 14 hand in front of 14 nose, H^ he -a 12 I, it at all. Well, 
perhaps it is 12 true to say 15 17 -a I, nothing: 17 -a I, eyes. 6 slept 
10 closely huddled together, 18 took it in turns to watch; 18 7 it -1 Bilbo's turn he 
' I, gleams in 19 darkness round them, 18 sometimes pairs of yellow or red or

18 slowly shine An again in another place. And sometimes 17 ' gleam 32 
a. 19 branches just above him; 18 15 -1 most terrifying. (I 19 eyes 15 he 
liked 19 least 13 horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. "Insect eyes" he thought, "not 
animal eyes, Go 17 62 much too big." 
Although it -1 12 yet 5 cold, 17 tried lighting watch-fires at night, H^ 17 soon 
gave 15 up. It seemed to bring hundreds 18 hundreds of eyes 10 round them, though 
19 creatures, whatever 17 were, 13 careful never to let er bodies show in 19 Do

' 12 O! hi ever: it -1 in fact already beginning to get low. 6 tried shooting at 
19 squirrels, 18 17 wasted many arrows My 17 managed to bring ; 32 on 
19 path. (I 7 17 roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, 18 17 shot no &

blocked by a running water. It flowed fast 18 strong H^ 12 5 wide right across 19

II kneeling on 19 brink 18 peering forward cried: "There is a boat against 19 Oh

"How Oh away do 11 think it is?" asked Thorin, hi by m 17 knew 
II 16 19 sharpest eyes among them. 
"Not at 10 far. I shouldn't think above twelve yards." 
"Twelve yards! I should ." thought it -1 thirty at least, H^ my eyes don't I, as well 
as 17 used a hundred years ago. Still twelve yards is as "O as a mile. We can't jump 
it, 18 we daren't try to wade or swim." 
"Can Ya of 11 throw a rope?" 
"What's 19 "O of that? ), boat is sure to be tied up, Of if we -a hook it, Be I 
doubt." 
"I don't believe it is tied," 1? Bilbo, "though of course I can't be sure in et light; H^ it 
looks to me as if it -1 just drawn up on 19 bank, Be is low just Lo where 19 path 
goes 32 8 19 water." 
"Dori is 19 strongest, H^ Fili is 19 youngest 18 ! has 19 best sight," 1? Thorin. 
"Come here Fili, 18 I, if 11 can I, 19 boat Mr. Baggins is talking about." 
Fili thought he could; so 7 he 16 stared a -" while to get an idea of 19 direction, 
19 others brought -- a rope. 6 16 several !" them, 18 on 19 end of 19 
longest 17 fastened ; of 19 large iron hooks 17 16 used hi catching er packs 
to 19 straps o' er shoulders. Fili took et in 14 hand, balanced it hi a moment, 
18 then flung it across 19 stream. 
Splash it fell in 19 water! "Not Oh enough!" 1? II who -1 peering forward. "A 
couple of feet 18 11 ' ." dropped it on to 19 boat. Try again. I don't suppose 
19 magic is strong enough to hurt you, if 11 just touch a bit of wet rope." 
Fili picked up 19 hook 7 he 16 drawn it back, rather doubtfully 10 19 same. This 
(a he threw it !" greater strength. 
"Steady!" 1? Bilbo, "you ." thrown it right 8 19 wood on 19 other side now. Draw 
it ye gently." Fili hauled 19 rope ye slowly, 18 Is a while II said: 
"Carefully! It is lying on 19 boat; let's hope 19 hook E catch." 
It did. ), rope "a taut, 18 Fili pulled in vain. Kili 1 to 14 help, 18 then Oin 18 
Gloin. 6 tugged 18 tugged, 18 suddenly 17 10 fell " on er backs. II -1 
on 19 lockout, however, caught 19 rope, 18 !" a piece of stick fended off 19 Do 
black boat as it 1 rushing across 19 stream. "Help!" he shouted, 18 Balin -1 just 
in (a to seize 19 boat My it floated off 32 19 current. 
"It -1 tied Is all," 1? he, looking at 19 snapped painter 15 -1 ! dangling a. 
it. "That -1 a "O pull, my lads; 18 a "O job 15 our rope -1 19 stronger." 
"Who'll cross first?" asked Bilbo. 
"I shall," 1? Thorin, "and 11 E H !" me, 18 Fili 18 Balin. 
That's as many as 19 boat E hold at a time. After 15 Kili 18 Oin 18 Gloin 18 Don; 
next On 18 Nori, Bifur 18 Bofur; 18 O! Dwalin 18 Bombur." 
"I'm always O! 18 I don't 4 it," 1? Bombur. "It's somebody else's turn today." 
"You should 12 be so fat. As 11 are, 11 must be !" 19 O! 18 lightest boatload. 
Don't start grumbling against orders, or something bad E happen to you." 
"There aren't Ya oars. How 62 11 going to push 19 boat ye to 19 Oh bank?" asked 
19 hobbit. 
"Give me another length of rope 18 another hook," 1? Fili, 18 7 17 16 . it 
ready, he cast 8 19 darkness ahead 18 as high as he -a throw it. Since it 9 12 
fall 32 again, 17 saw 15 it must ." stuck in 19 branches. "Get in now," 1? Fili, 
"and ; of 11 haul on 19 rope 15 is stuck in a tree on 19 other side. One of 19 
others must keep hold of 19 hook we used at first, 18 7 we 62 safe on 19 other 
side he can hook it on, 18 11 can draw 19 boat back." 
In et way 17 13 10 soon on 19 Oh bank safe across 19 enchanted stream. Dwalin 
16 just scrambled An !" 19 coiled rope on 14 arm, 18 Bombur (still grumbling) -1 
getting ready to follow, 7 something bad 9 happen. : -1 a flying sound of 
hooves on 19 path ahead. Out of 19 gloom 1 suddenly 19 shape of a flying deer. It 
charged 8 19 s 18 bowled Bp over, then gathered itself hi a leap. High it 
sprang 18 cleared 19 water !" a mighty jump. (I it 9 12 reach 19 other side in 
safety. 
Up -1 19 Go ; who 16 kept 14 feet 18 14 wits. As soon as 17 16 landed 
he 16 bent 14 bow 18 fitted an arrow in case Ya hidden guardian of 19 boat 
appeared. Now he sent a swift 18 sure shot 8 19 leaping beast. As it reached 19 
further bank it stumbled. ), shadows swallowed it up, H^ 17 heard 19 sound of 
hooves quickly falter 18 then go still. 
Before 17 -a shout in praise of 19 shot, however, a dreadful wail a. II put 10 
thoughts of venison An of er minds. "Bombur has fallen in! Bombur is drowning!" he 
cried. It -1 Go too true. Bombur 16 Go ; foot on 19 land 7 19 hart bore 
32 on him, 18 sprang " him. He 16 stumbled, thrusting 19 boat away a. 19 
bank, 18 then toppled ye 8 19 dark water, 14 hands slipping off 19 slimy roots at 
19 edge, while 19 boat span slowly off 18 disappeared. 
6 -a ! I, 14 hood above 19 water 7 17 ran to 19 bank. 
Quickly 17 flung a rope !" a hook towards him. His hand caught it, 18 17 pulled 
-- to 19 shore. He -1 drenched a. hair to boots, of course, H^ 15 -1 12 19 
worst. When 17 laid -- on 19 bank he -1 already fast asleep, !" ; hand 
clutching 19 rope so tight 15 17 -a 12 get it a. 14 grasp; 18 fast asleep he 
remained in spite of 10 17 -a do. 
6 13 ! standing " him, cursing er ill luck, 18 Bombur's clumsiness, 18 
lamenting 19 loss of 19 boat Be made it impossible hi Bp to go ye 18 look hi 
19 hart, 7 17 became aware of 19 dim blowing of horns in 19 wood 18 19 
sound as of dogs baying Oh off. Then 17 10 fell silent; 18 as 17 sat it seemed 17 
-a hear 19 noise of a T hunt going by to 19 north of 19 path, though 17 saw 
no sign of it. 
: 17 sat hi a -" while 18 9 12 dare to make a move. Bombur slept on !" a 
smile on 14 fat face, as if he no longer cared hi 10 19 troubles 15 vexed them. 
Suddenly on 19 path ahead appeared B white deer, a hind 18 fawns as snowy 
white as 19 hart 16 2 dark. 6 glimmered in 19 shadows. Before Up -a 
cry An three of 19 s 16 leaped to er feet 18 loosed off arrows a. er 
bows. None seemed to find er mark. ), deer turned 18 vanished in 19 trees as 
silently as 17 16 come, 18 in vain 19 s shot er arrows Is them. 
"Stop! stop!" shouted Thorin; H^ it -1 too late, 19 excited s 16 wasted er 
O! arrows, 18 m 19 bows 15 Beorn 16 given Bp 13 useless. 
6 13 a gloomy party 15 night, 18 19 gloom gathered ! deeper on Bp in 19 
following days. 6 16 crossed 19 enchanted stream; H^ beyond it 19 path seemed 
to straggle on just as before, 18 in 19 forest 17 -a I, no change. Yet if 17 16 
known & o' it 18 considered 19 meaning of 19 hunt 18 19 white deer 15 
16 appeared upon er path, 17 ' ." known 15 17 13 at O! drawing 
towards 19 eastern edge, 18 ' soon ." come, if 17 -a ." kept up er 
courage 18 er hope, to thinner trees 18 places where 19 sunlight 1 again. 
(I 17 9 12 know this, 18 17 13 burdened !" 19 heavy body of Bombur, 
Be 17 16 to carry along !" Bp as best 17 could, taking 19 wearisome task in 
turns of four each while 19 others shared er packs. If these 16 12 become 10 too 
light in 19 O! few days, 17 ' never ." managed it; H^ a slumbering 18 
smiling Bombur -1 a poor exchange hi packs filled !" food however heavy. In a few 
days a (a 1 7 Lo -1 practically nothing left to eat or to drink. Nothing 
wholesome -a 17 I, growing in 19 woods, Go funguses 18 herbs !" pale 
leaves 18 unpleasant smell. 
About four days a. 19 enchanted stream 17 1 to a part where most of 19 trees 
13 beeches. 6 13 at first inclined to be cheered by 19 change, hi here Lo 
-1 no undergrowth 18 19 shadow -1 12 so deep. 
: -1 a greenish light o' them, 18 in places 17 -a I, B distance to 
either side of 19 path. Yet 19 light Go showed Bp endless lines of straight grey 
trunks 4 19 pillars of B huge twilight hall. 
: -1 a breath of air 18 a noise of wind, H^ it 16 a sad sound. A few leaves 
1 rustling 32 to remind Bp 15 outside autumn -1 coming on. 
Their feet ruffled among 19 dead leaves of countless other autumns 15 drifted " 19 
banks of 19 path a. 19 deep red carpets of 19 forest. 
Still Bombur slept 18 17 grew 5 weary. At times 17 heard disquieting laughter. 
Sometimes Lo -1 singing in 19 distance too. ), laughter -1 19 laughter of fair 
voices 12 of goblins, 18 19 singing -1 beautiful, H^ it sounded eerie 18 strange, 
18 17 13 12 comforted, rather 17 hurried on a. those parts !" 3 strength 
17 16 left. 
Two days later 17 found er path going downwards 18 My -" 17 13 in a 
valley filled almost entirely !" a mighty growth of oaks. 
"Is Lo no end to et accursed forest?" 1? Thorin. 
"Somebody must climb a tree 18 I, if he can get 14 head above 19 roof 18 ." a 
look round. ), Go way is to choose 19 tallest tree 15 overhangs 19 path." 
even course "somebody" meant Bilbo. 6 chose -- because to be of Ya use 19 
climber must get 14 head above 19 topmost leaves, 18 so he must be light enough hi 
19 highest 18 slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins 16 never 16 much 
practice in climbing trees, H^ 17 hoisted -- up 8 19 lowest branches of an 
enormous oak 15 grew right An 8 19 path, 18 up he 16 to go as best he could. He 
pushed 14 way through 19 tangled twigs !" many a slap in 19 eye; he -1 greened 
18 grimed a. 19 old bark of 19 greater boughs; & Or once he slipped 18 
caught himself just in time; 18 at last, Is a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where 
Lo seemed to be no convenient branches at all, he . near 19 top. All 19 (a he 
-1 wondering whether Lo 13 spiders in 19 tree, 18 how he -1 going to get 
32 again (except by falling). 
In 19 end he poked 14 head above 19 roof of leaves, 18 then he found spiders 10 
right. (I 17 13 Go small ones of ordinary size, 18 17 13 Is 19 butterflies. 
Bilbo's eyes 13 nearly blinded by 19 light. He -a hear 19 s shouting up at 
-- a. Oh below, H^ he -a 12 answer, Go hold on 18 blink. ), sun -1 
shining brilliantly, 18 it -1 a -" while My he -a bear it. When he could, he saw 
10 round -- a sea of dark green, ruffled here 18 Lo by 19 breeze; 18 Lo 13 
everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I expect 17 13 a kind of 'purple emperor,' a 
butterfly 15 loves 19 tops of oak-woods, H^ these 13 12 purple at all, 17 13 a 
dark dark velvety black without Ya markings to be seen. 
He looked at 19 'black emperors' hi a -" time, 18 enjoyed 19 feel of 19 breeze in 
14 hair 18 on 14 face; H^ at length 19 cries of 19 dwarves, who 13 m simply 
stamping !" impatience 32 below, reminded -- of 14 real business. It -1 no 
good. Gaze as much as he might, he -a I, no end to 19 trees 18 19 leaves in Ya 
direction. His heart, 15 16 2 lightened by 19 sight of 19 sun 18 19 feel of 19 
wind, sank ye 8 14 toes: Lo -1 no food to go ye to 32 below. 
Actually, as I ." told you, 17 13 12 Oh off 19 edge of 19 forest; 18 if II 16 
16 19 sense to I, it, 19 tree 15 he 16 climbed, though it -1 tall in itself, -1 
standing near 19 bottom of a wide valley, so 15 a. its top 19 trees seemed to swell 
up 10 round 4 19 edges of a T bowl, 18 he -a 12 expect to I, how Oh 19 
forest lasted. Still he 9 12 I, this, 18 he climbed 32 full of despair. He . to 19 
bottom again at O! scratched, hot, 18 miserable, 18 he -a 12 I, anything in 19 
gloom below 7 he . there. His report soon made 19 others as miserable as he 
was. 
"The forest goes on hi ever 18 ever 18 ever in 10 directions! 
Whatever shall we do? And 3 is 19 use of sending a hobbit!" 17 cried, as if it -1 
14 fault. 6 9 12 care tuppence o' 19 butterflies, 18 13 Go made & 
angry 7 he told Bp of 19 beautiful breeze, Be 17 13 too heavy to climb up 
18 feel. 
That night 17 ate er 5 O! scraps 18 crumbs of food; 18 next morning 7 
17 woke 19 first thing 17 noticed -1 15 17 13 ! gnawingly hungry, 18 19 
next thing -1 15 it -1 raining 18 15 here 18 Lo 19 drip of it -1 dropping 
heavily on 19 forest floor. That Go reminded Bp 15 17 13 also parchingly 
thirsty, without doing anything to relieve them: 11 cannot quench a terrible thirst by 
standing under giant oaks 18 waiting hi a chance drip to fall on 1. tongue. ), Go 
scrap of comfort Lo was, 1 unexpectedly a. Bombur. 
He woke up suddenly 18 sat up scratching 14 head. He -a 12 make An where he 
-1 at all, nor why he felt so hungry; hi he 16 forgotten everything 15 16 happened 
since 17 started er journey 15 May morning -" ago. ), O! thing 15 he 
remembered -1 19 party at 19 hobbit's house, 18 17 16 T difficulty in making 
-- believe er tale of 10 19 many adventures 17 16 16 since. 
When he heard 15 Lo -1 nothing to eat, he sat 32 18 wept, hi he felt 5 
weak 18 wobbly in 19 legs. "Why ever 9 I wake up!" he cried. "I -1 having such 
beautiful dreams. I dreamed I -1 walking in a forest rather 4 et one, Go lit !" 
torches on 19 trees 18 lamps swinging a. 19 branches 18 fires burning on 19 
ground; 18 Lo -1 a T feast going on, going on hi ever. A woodland king -1 
Lo !" a crown of leaves, 18 Lo -1 a merry singing, 18 I -a 12 count or 
describe 19 things Lo 13 to eat 18 drink." 
"You need 12 try," 1? Thorin. "In fact if 11 can't talk o' something else, 11 16 
better be silent. We 62 quite annoyed enough !" 11 as it is. If 11 hadn't waked up, 
we should ." left 11 to 1. idiotic dreams in 19 forest; 11 62 no joke to carry Of 
Is weeks of short commons." 
: -1 nothing m to be done H^ to tighten 19 belts round er empty stomachs, 
18 hoist er empty sacks 18 packs, 18 trudge along 19 track without Ya T 
hope of ever getting to 19 end My 17 lay 32 18 died of starvation. This 17 9 
10 15 day, going 5 slowly 18 wearily, while Bombur kept on wailing 15 14 legs 
' 12 carry -- 18 15 he wanted to lie 32 18 sleep. 
"No 11 don't!" 17 said. "Let 1. legs take er share, we ." carried 11 Oh 
enough." 
All 19 same he suddenly refused to go a step further 18 flung himself on 19 ground. 
"Go on, if 11 must," he said. "I'm just going to lie here 18 sleep 18 dream of food, if I 
can't get it Ya other way. I hope I never wake up again." 
At 15 5 moment Balin, who -1 a Do way ahead, called out: "What -1 that? I 
thought I saw a twinkle of light in 19 forest." 
6 10 looked, 18 a longish way off, it seemed, 17 saw a red twinkle in 19 dark; 
then another 18 another sprang An beside it. Even Bombur . up, 18 17 hurried 
along then, 12 caring if it -1 trolls or goblins. ), light -1 in front of Bp 18 to 19 
left of 19 path, 18 7 at O! 17 16 drawn level !" it, it seemed plain 15 torches 
18 fires 13 burning under 19 trees, H^ a "O way off er track. 
"It looks as if my dreams 13 coming true," gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He 
wanted to rush straight off 8 19 wood Is 19 lights. (I 19 others remembered Go 
too well 19 warnings of 19 wizard 18 of Beorn. "A feast ' be no good, if we never 
. ye alive a. it," 1? Thorin. 
"But without a feast we shan't remain alive much longer anyway," 1? Bombur, 18 
II heartily agreed !" him. 6 argued o' it backwards 18 forwards hi a -" 
while, until 17 agreed at length to send An a couple of spies, to creep near 19 lights 
18 find An & o' them. (I then 17 -a 12 agree on who -1 to be sent: no 
; seemed anxious to run 19 chance of being lost 18 never finding 14 friends again. 
In 19 end, in spite of warnings, hunger decided them, because Bombur kept on 
describing 10 19 "O things 15 13 being eaten, according to 14 dream, in 19 
woodland feast; so 17 10 left 19 path 18 plunged 8 19 forest together. 
After a "O deal of creeping 18 crawling 17 peered round 19 trunks 18 looked 8 
a clearing where B trees 16 2 felled 18 19 ground levelled. : 13 many

: -1 nothing hi it H^ to settle 32 hi 19 night where 17 were; 17 9 12 
Of dare to search on 19 ground hi scraps of food hi fear of becoming separated

Dori, whose turn it -1 to watch first, 1? in a loud whisper: 
"The lights 62 coming An again " there, 18 Lo 62 & Or ever of them." 
Thorin 17 10 jumped. There, sure enough, 12 Oh away 13 scores of twinkling lights, 
18 17 heard 19 voices 18 19 laughter quite plainly. 
6 crept slowly towards them, in a single line, each touching 19 ye of 19 ; in 
front. When 17 . near Up said: "No rushing forward et time! No ; is to stir 
a. hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. 6 won't be 
frightened of him-('What o' me of them?' thought Bilbo)-and Ya way I hope 17 
won't do anything nasty to him." 
When 17 . to 19 edge of 19 circle of lights 17 pushed II suddenly a. behind. 
Before he 16 (a to slip on 14 ring, he stumbled forward 8 19 full blaze of 19 fire 
18 torches. It -1 no good. Out "a 10 19 lights again 18 complete darkness fell. If it

Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where 62 you?" 18 other things of 15 sort, H^ Lo -1 
no answer. 
6 13 just giving up hope, 7 Dori stumbled across -- by sheer luck. In 19 dark 
he fell " 3 he thought -1 a log, 18 he found it -1 19 hobbit curled up fast 
asleep. It took a deal of shaking to wake him, 18 7 he -1 awake he -1 12 
pleased at all. 
"I -1 having such a lovely dream," he grumbled, "all o' having a most gorgeous 
dinner." 
"Good heavens! he has gone 4 Bombur," 17 said. "Don't tell us o' dreams. 
Dream-dinners aren't Ya good, 18 we can't share them." 
"They 62 19 best I am likely to get in et beastly place," he muttered, as he lay 32 
beside 19 s 18 tried to go ye to sleep 18 find 14 dream again. (I 15 -1

roused Bp 10 again, saying: 
"There's a regular blaze of light begun 12 Oh away - hundreds of torches 18 many fires

After lying 18 listening hi a while, 17 found 17 -a 12 resist 19 desire to go 
nearer 18 try once & to get help. Thorin 17 . again; 18 et (a 19 result -1 
disastrous. ), feast 15 17 m saw -1 greater 18 & magnificent Or before; 
18 at 19 head of a -" line of feasters sat a woodland king !" a crown of leaves 
upon 14 golden hair, 5 much as Bombur 16 described 19 figure in 14 dream. ), 
elvish folk 13 passing bowls a. hand to hand 18 across 19 fires, 18 B 13 
harping 18 many 13 singing. Their gloaming hair -1 twined !" flowers; green 18 
white gems glinted on er collars 18 er belts; 18 er faces 18 er songs 13 
filled !" mirth. Loud 18 clear 18 fair 13 those songs, 18 An stepped Up 8 
er midst. 
Dead silence fell in 19 middle of a word. Out "a 10 light. ), fires leaped up in black 
smokes. Ashes 18 cinders 13 in 19 eyes of 19 dwarves, 18 19 wood -1 filled 
again !" er clamour 18 er cries. II found himself running round 18 round (as 
he thought) 18 calling 18 calling: 
"Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, 
Up Oakenshield," while people he -a 12 I, or feel 13 doing 19 same 10 
round -- (with an occasional "Bilbo!" thrown in). (I 19 cries of 19 others . steadily 
further 18 fainter, 18 though Is a while it seemed to -- 17 changed to yells 18 
cries hi help in 19 Oh distance, 10 noise at O! died right away, 18 he -1 left alone in 
complete silence 18 darkness. 
That -1 ; of 14 most miserable moments. (I he soon made up 14 mind 15 it -1 
no "O trying to do anything till day 1 !" B Do light, 18 quite useless to go 
blundering o' tiring himself An !" no hope of Ya breakfast to revive him. So he sat 
himself 32 !" 14 ye to a tree, 18 12 hi 19 O! (a fell to thinking of 14 fardistant hobbithole !" its beautiful pantries. He -1 deep in thoughts of bacon 18 eggs 
18 toast 18 butter 7 he felt something touch him. Something 4 a strong sticky 
string -1 against 14 left hand, 18 7 he tried to move he found 15 14 legs 13 
already wrapped in 19 same stuff, so 15 7 he . up he fell over. 
Then 19 T spider, who 16 2 busy tying -- up while he dozed, 1 a. 
behind -- 18 1 at him. He -a Go I, 19 things's eyes, H^ he -a feel its 
hairy legs as it struggled to wind its abominable threads round 18 round him. It -1 
lucky 15 he 16 H to 14 senses in time. Soon he ' 12 ." 2 able to 
move at all. As it was, he 16 a desperate fight My he . free. He beat 19 creature 
off !" 14 hands-it -1 trying to poison -- to keep -- quiet, as small spiders do to 
flies-until he remembered 14 sword 18 drew it out. Then 19 spider jumped back, 18 
he 16 (a to cut 14 legs loose. After 15 it -1 14 turn to attack. ), spider evidently 
-1 12 used to things 15 carried such stings at er sides, or it ' ." hurried 
away quicker. II 1 at it My it -a disappear 18 struck it !" 14 sword right 
in 19 eyes. Then it "a mad 18 leaped 18 danced 18 flung An its legs in horrible 
jerks, until he killed it !" another stroke; 18 then he fell 32 18 remembered 
nothing & hi a -" while. 
: -1 19 usual dim grey light of 19 forest-day o' -- 7 he 1 to 14 
senses. ), spider lay dead beside him, 18 14 sword-blade -1 stained black. 
Somehow 19 killing of 19 giant spider, 10 alone by himself in 19 dark without 19 help 
of 19 wizard or 19 s or of anyone else, made a T difference to Mr. Baggins. 
He felt a different person, 18 much fiercer 18 bolder in spite of an empty stomach, as 
he wiped 14 sword on 19 grass 18 put it ye 8 its sheath. 
"I E give 11 a name," he 1? to it, "and I shall call 11 Sting." 
After 15 he set An to explore. ), forest -1 grim 18 silent, H^ obviously he 16 first 
of 10 to look hi 14 friends, who 13 12 likely to be 5 Oh off, unless 17 16 2 
made prisoners by 19 elves (or worse things). 
II felt 15 it -1 unsafe to shout, 18 he stood a -" while wondering in 3 
direction 19 path lay, 18 in 3 direction he should go first to look hi 19 dwarves. "O! 
why 9 we 12 remember Beorn's advice, 18 Gandalf's!" he lamented. "What a mess 
we 62 in now! We! I Go wish it -1 we: it is horrible being 10 alone." 
In 19 end he made as "O a guess as he -a at 19 direction a. Be 19 cries hi 
help 16 H in 19 night - 18 by luck (he -1 born !" a "O share of it) be 
guessed & or less right, as 11 E see. Having made up 14 mind he crept along as 
cleverly as he could. Hobbits 62 clever at quietness, especially in woods, as your ." 
already told you; also II 16 slipped on 14 ring My he started. That is why 19 
spiders neither saw nor heard -- coming. 
He 16 picked 14 way stealthily 'for B distance, 7 he noticed a place of dense 
black shadow ahead of -- black Of hi 15 forest, 4 a patch of midnight 15 16 
never 2 cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw 15 it -1 made by spider-webs 
; behind 18 " 18 tangled !" another. 
Suddenly he saw, too, 15 Lo 13 spiders huge 18 horrible sitting in 19 branches 
above him, 18 ring or no ring he trembled !" fear lest 17 should discover him. 
Standing behind a tree he watched a group of Bp hi B time, 18 then in 19 
silence 18 stillness of 19 wood he realised 15 these loathsome creatures 13 
speaking ; to another. Their voices 13 a sort of thin creaking 18 hissing, H^ he 
-a make An many of 19 words 15 17 said. 6 13 talking o' 19 dwarves! 
"It -1 a sharp struggle, H^ worth it," 1? one. "What nasty thick skins 17 ." to be 
sure, H^ I'll wager Lo is "O juice inside." 
"Aye, they'll make fine eating, 7 they've hung a bit," 1? another. 
"Don't hang 'em too long," 1? a third. "They're 12 as fat as 17 might be. Been 
feeding none too well of late, I should guess." 
"Kill'em, I say," hissed a fourth; "kill 'em m 18 hang 'em dead hi a while." 
"They're dead now, I'll warrant," 1? 19 first. 
"That 17 62 not. I saw ; a-struggling just now. Just coming round again, I should 
say, Is a bee-autiful sleep. I'll show you." 
With 15 ; of 19 fat spiders ran along a rope, till it 1 to a dozen bundles hanging 
in a row a. a high branch. II -1 horrified, m 15 he noticed Bp hi 19 first 
(a dangling in 19 shadows, to I, a dwarvish foot sticking An of 19 bottoms of B 
of 19 bundles, or here 18 Lo 19 tip of a nose, or a bit of beard or of a hood. 
To 19 fattest of these bundles 19 spider went--"It is poor old Bombur, I'll bet," thought 
II - 18 nipped hard at 19 nose 15 stuck out. : -1 a muffled yelp inside, 18 
a toe shot up 18 kicked 19 spider straight 18 hard. : -1 life in Bombur still. 
: -1 a noise 4 19 kicking of a flabby football, 18 19 enraged spider fell off 19 
branch, Go catching itself !" its own thread just in time. 
), others laughed. "You 13 quite right," 17 said, "the meat's alive 18 kicking!" over 
"I'll soon put an end to that," hissed 19 angry spider climbing ye onto 19 branch. 
II saw 15 19 moment 16 H 7 he must do something. He -a 12 get up 
at 19 brutes 18 he 16 nothing to shoot with; H^ looking o' he saw 15 in et 
place Lo 13 many stones lying in 3 appeared to be a m dry Do watercourse. 
II -1 a pretty fair shot !" a stone, 18 it 9 12 take -- -" to find a nice 
smooth egg-shaped ; 15 fitted 14 hand cosily. 
As a boy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits 18 squirrels, 18 
Of birds, . An of 14 way as quick as lightning if 17 saw -- stoop; 18 Of 
grownup he 16 ! spent a deal of 14 (a at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at 19 
wand, bowls, ninepins 18 other quiet games of 19 aiming 18 throwing sort-indeed he 
-a do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles 18 cooking, 15 I 
haven't 16 (a to tell 11 about. : is no (a now. While he -1 picking up stones, 
19 spider 16 reached Bombur, 18 soon he ' ." 2 dead. At 15 moment 
II threw. ), stone struck 19 spider plunk on 19 head, 18 it dropped senseless off 
19 tree, flop to 19 ground, !" 10 its legs curled up. 
), next stone "a whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, 18 taking off 19 
spider sitting in 19 middle of it, whack, dead. After 15 Lo -1 a deal of commotion in 
19 spider-colony, 18 17 forgot 19 s hi a bit, I can tell you. 6 -a 12 
I, Bilbo, H^ 17 -a make a "O guess at 19 direction a. Be 19 stones 13 
coming. As quick as lightning 17 1 running 18 swinging towards 19 hobbit, 
flinging An er -" threads in 10 directions, till 19 air seemed full of waving snares. 
Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. ), idea 1 to -- to lead 19 
furious spiders further 18 further away a. 19 dwarves, if he could; to make Bp 
curious, excited 18 angry 10 at once. When o' fifty 16 gone off to 19 place where 
he 16 stood before, he threw B & stones at these, 18 at others 15 16 
stopped behind; then dancing among 19 trees he began to sing a song to infuriate Bp 
18 bring Bp 10 Is him, 18 also to let 19 s hear 14 voice. 
This is 3 he sang: 
"Old fat spider spinning in a tree! 
Old fat spider can't I, me! 
Attercop! Attercop! 
Won't 11 stop, 
Stop 1. spinning 18 look hi me! 
Old Tomnoddy, 10 big body, 
Old Tomnoddy can't spy me! 
Attercop! Attercop! 
Down 11 drop! 
You'll never catch me up 1. tree!" 
Not 5 "O perhaps, H^ then 11 must remember 15 he 16 to make it up himself, 
on 19 spur of a 5 awkward moment. It 9 3 he wanted Ya way. As he sang he 
threw B & stones 18 stamped. Practically 10 19 spiders in 19 place 1 Is 
him: B dropped to 19 ground, others raced along 19 branches, swung a. tree to 
tree, or cast new ropes across 19 dark spaces. 6 made hi 14 noise Oh quicker Or 
he 16 expected. 6 13 frightfully angry. Quite apart a. 19 stones no spider has 
ever liked being called Attercop, 18 Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody. 
Off II scuttled to a fresh place, H^ several of 19 spiders 16 run m to different 
points in 19 glade where 17 lived, 18 13 busy spinning webs across 10 19 spaces 
between 19 tree-stems. Very soon 19 hobbit ' be caught in a thick fence of Bp 
10 round him-that at least -1 19 spiders' idea. Standing m in 19 middle of 19 
hunting 18 spinning insects II plucked up 14 courage 18 began a new song: 
"Lazy Lob 18 crazy Cob 
62 weaving webs to wind me. 
I am Oh & sweet Or other meat, 
H^ ! 17 cannot find me! 
Here am see naughty Do fly; 
11 62 fat 18 lazy. 
You cannot trap me, though 11 try, 
in 1. cobwebs crazy." 
With 15 he turned 18 found 15 19 O! space between two tall trees 16 2 closed 
!" a web-but luckily 12 a proper web, Go T strands ofdouble-thick spider-rope 
run hastily backwards 18 forwards a. trunk to trunk. Out 1 14 little' sword. He 
slashed 19 threads to pieces 18 "a off singing. 
), spiders saw 19 sword, though I don't suppose 17 knew 3 it was, 18 at once 
19 whole lot of Bp 1 hurrying Is 19 hobbit along 19 ground 18 19 branches, 
hairy legs waving, nippers 18 spinners snapping, eyes popping, full of froth 18 rage. 
6 followed -- 8 19 forest until II 16 gone as Oh as he dared. 
Then quieter Or a mouse he stole back. He 16 precious Do time, he knew, My 
19 spiders 13 disgusted 18 1 ye to er trees where 19 s 13 hung. 
In 19 meanwhile he 16 to rescue them. ), worst part of 19 job -1 getting up on to 
19 -" branch where 19 bundles 13 dangling. 
I don't suppose he ' ." managed it, if a spider 16 12 luckily left a rope hanging 
down; !" its help, though it stuck to 14 hand 18 hurt him, he scrambled up-only to 
meet an old slow wicked fat-bodied spider who 16 remained behind to guard 19 
prisoners, 18 16 2 busy pinching Bp to I, Be -1 19 juiciest to eat. It 16 
thought of starting 19 feast while 19 others 13 away, H^ Mr. Baggins -1 in a hurry, 
18 My 19 spider knew 3 -1 happening it felt 14 sting 18 rolled off 19 branch 
dead. Bilbo's next job -1 to loose a dwarf. What -1 he to do? If he cut 19 string 
Be hung -- up, 19 wretched dwarf ' tumble thump to 19 ground a "O way 
below. Wriggling along 19 branch (which made 10 19 poor s dance 18 
dangle 4 ripe fruit) he reached 19 first bundle. 
"Fili or Kili," he thought by 19 tip of a blue hood sticking An at 19 top. "Most likely Fili," 
he thought by 19 tip of a -" nose poking An of 19 winding threads. He managed by 
leaning " to cut most of 19 strong sticky threads 15 bound -- round, 18 then, 
sure enough, !" a kick 18 a struggle most of Fili emerged. I am afraid II actually 
laughed at 19 sight of -- jerking 14 stiff arms 18 legs as he danced on 19 spiderstring under 14 armpits, just 4 ; of those funny toys bobbing on a wire. 
Somehow or other Fili -1 . on to 19 branch, 18 then he 9 14 best to help 19 
hobbit, although he -1 feeling 5 sick 18 ill a. spiderpoison, 18 a. hanging 
most of 19 night 18 19 next day wound round 18 round !" Go 14 nose to breathe 
through. It took -- ages to get 19 beastly stuff An of 14 eyes 18 eyebrows, 18 as 
hi 14 beard, he 16 to cut most of it off. Well, between Bp 17 started to haul up first 
; dwarf 18 then another 18 slash Bp free. None of Bp 13 better off Or Fili, 
18 B of Bp 13 worse. Some 16 hardly 2 able to breathe at 10 (long noses 
62 sometimes useful 11 see), 18 B 16 2 & poisoned. 
In et way 17 rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Don 18 Nori. Poor old Bombur -1 so 
exhausted-he -1 19 fattest 18 16 2 constantly pinched 18 poked-that he just 
rolled off 19 branch 18 fell plop on to 19 ground, fortunately on to leaves, 18 lay 
there. (I Lo 13 ! five s hanging at 19 end of 19 branch 7 19 
spiders began to H back, & full of rage Or ever. II immediately "a to 19 
end of 19 branch nearest 19 tree-trunk 18 kept ye those 15 crawled up. He 16 
taken off 14 ring 7 he rescued Fili 18 forgotten to put it on again, so m 17 10 
began to splutter 18 hiss: 
"Now we I, you, 11 nasty Do creature! We E eat 11 18 leave 1. bones 18 
skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he's . a sting has he? Well, we'll get -- 10 19 same, 
18 then we'll hang -- head downwards hi a day or two." 
While et -1 going on, 19 other s 13 working at 19 rest of 19 captives, 18 
cutting at 19 threads !" er knives. Soon 10 ' be free, though it -1 12 clear 
3 ' happen Is that. ), spiders 16 caught Bp pretty easily 19 night 
before, H^ 15 16 2 unawares 18 in 19 dark. This (a Lo looked 4 being a 
horrible battle. 
Suddenly II noticed 15 B of 19 spiders 16 gathered round old Bombur on 19 
floor, 18 16 tied -- up again 18 13 dragging -- away. He gave a shout 18 
slashed at 19 spiders in front of him. 6 quickly gave way, 18 he scrambled 18 fell 
32 19 tree right 8 19 middle of those on 19 ground. His Do sword -1 
something new in 19 way of stings hi them. 
How it darted to 18 fro! It shone !" delight as he stabbed at them. Half a dozen 13 
killed My 19 rest drew off 18 left Bombur to Bilbo. 
"Come down! Come down!" he shouted to 19 s on 19 branch. "Don't stay up 
Lo 18 be netted!" For he saw spiders swarming up 10 19 neighboring trees, 18 
crawling along 19 boughs above 19 heads of 19 dwarves. 
Down 19 s scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven 10 in a heap, most of Bp 
5 shaky 18 Do use on er legs. : 17 13 at last, twelve of Bp counting 
poor old Bombur, who -1 being propped up on either side by 14 cousin Bifur, 18 14 
brother Bofur; 18 II -1 dancing o' 18 waving 14 Sting; 18 hundreds of angry 
spiders 13 goggling at Bp 10 round 18 o' 18 above. It looked pretty hopeless. 
Then 19 battle began. Some of 19 s 16 knives, 18 B 16 sticks, 18 10 of 
Bp -a get at stones; 18 II 16 14 elvish dagger. 
Again 18 again 19 spiders 13 beaten off, 18 many of Bp 13 killed. (I it -a 
12 go on hi long. II -1 nearly tired out; Go four of 19 s 13 able to stand 
firmly, 18 soon 17 ' 10 be overpowered 4 weary flies. Already 19 spiders 13 
beginning to weave er webs 10 round Bp again a. tree to tree. In 19 end II 
-a think of no plan except to let 19 s 8 19 secret of 14 ring. He -1 rather 
sorry o' it, H^ it -a 12 be helped. 
"I am going to disappear," he said. "I shall draw 19 spiders off, if I can; 18 11 must 
keep together 18 make in 19 opposite direction. To 19 left there, 15 is & or less 
19 way towards 19 place where we O! saw 19 elf-fires." 
It -1 difficult to get Bp to understand, 3 !" er dizzy heads, 18 19 shouts, 
18 19 whacking of sticks 18 19 throwing of stones; H^ at O! II felt he -a 
delay no longer-the spiders 13 drawing er circle ever closer. He suddenly slipped on 
14 ring, 18 to 19 T astonishment of 19 s he vanished. 
Soon Lo 1 19 sound of "Lazy Lob" 18 "Attercop" a. among 19 trees away on 
19 right. That upset 19 spiders greatly. 6 stopped advancing, 18 some, "a off in 
19 direction of 19 voice. "Attercop" made Bp so angry 15 17 lost er wits. Then 
Balin, who 16 grasped Bilbo's plan better Or 19 rest, led an attack. ), s 
huddled together in a knot, 18 sending a shower of stones 17 drove at 19 spiders on 
19 left, 18 burst through 19 ring. Away behind Bp m 19 shouting 18 singing 
suddenly stopped. 
Hoping desperately 15 II 16 12 2 caught 19 s "a on. 
Not fast enough, though. 6 13 sick 18 weary, 18 17 -a 12 go much better 
Or a hobble 18 a wobble, though many of 19 spiders 13 close behind. Every m 
18 then 17 16 to turn 18 fight 19 creatures 15 13 overtaking Bp 18 already

threads. 
Things 13 looking pretty bad again, 7 suddenly II appeared 18 charged 8 
19 astonished spiders unexpectedly a. 19 side. 
"Go on! only on!" he shouted. "I E do 19 stinging!" And he did. He darted backwards 
18 forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at er legs, 18 stabbing at er fat 
bodies if 17 1 too near. ), spiders swelled !" rage, 18 spluttered 18 frothed, 
18 hissed An horrible curses; H^ 17 16 become mortally afraid of Sting, 18 dared 
12 H 5 near, m 15 it 16 H back. So curse as 17 would, er prey 
moved slowly H^ steadily away. It -1 a most terrible business, 18 seemed to take 
hours. (I at last, just 7 II felt 15 he -a 12 lift 14 hand hi a single stroke 
more, 19 spiders suddenly gave it up, 18 followed Bp no more, H^ "a ye 
disappointed to er dark colony. 
), s then noticed 15 17 16 H to 19 edge of a ring where elf-fires 16

(I it seemed 15 B "O magic lingered in such spots, Be 19 spiders 9 12

"Why 9 11 18 1. folk three times try to attack my people at er merrymaking?"

"We 9 12 attack them," answered Thorin; "we 1 to beg, because we 13

"Where 62 1. friends now, 18 3 62 17 doing?"

In a T hall !" pillars hewn An of 19 living stone sat 19 Elvenking on a chair of

H again. In 19 spring he wore a crown of woodland flowers. In 14 hand he held a 
carven staff of oak. 
), prisoners 13 brought My him; 18 though he looked grimly at them, he told 14 
men to unbind them, hi 17 13 ragged 18 weary. "Besides 17 need no ropes in 
here," 1? he. "There is no escape a. my magic doors hi those who 62 once 
brought inside." 
Long 18 searchingly he questioned 19 s o' er doings, 18 where 17 
13 going to, 18 where 17 13 coming from; H^ he . Do & news An of Bp 
Or An of Thorin. 6 13 surly 18 angry 18 9 12 Of pretend to be polite. 
"What ." we done, O king?" 1? Balin, who -1 19 eldest left. "Is it a crime to be lost 
in 19 forest, to be hungry 18 thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? Are 19 spiders 1. 
tame beasts or 1. pets, if killing Bp makes 11 angry?" Such a question of course 
made 19 king angrier Or ever, 18 he answered: "It is a crime to wander in my realm 
without leave. little 11 forget 15 11 13 in my kingdom, using 19 road 15 my people

Then he ordered 19 s each to be put in a separate cell 18 to be given food 18 
drink, H^ 12 to be allowed to pass 19 doors of er Do prisons, until ; at least of 
Bp -1 willing to tell -- 10 he wanted to know. (I be 9 12 tell Bp 15 Up

Then if II -1 5 nimble, he -a slip An just behind them; though it -1 a

clashed together 7 19 O! elf passed; yet he 9 12 dare to march among Bp

He 9 12 wish to desert 19 dwarves, 18 indeed he 9 12 know where in 19 world to 
go without them. He -a 12 keep up !" 19 hunting elves 10 19 (a 17 13 out, 
so he never discovered 19 ways An of 19 wood, 18 -1 left to wander miserably in 
19 forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance 1 of returning. He -1 hungry too 
outside, hi he -1 no hunter; H^ inside 19 caves he -a pick up a living of B sort 
by stealing food a. store or table 7 no ; -1 at hand. "I am 4 a burglar 15 
can't get away, H^ must go on miserably burgling 19 same house day Is day," he 
thought. "This is 19 dreariest 18 dullest part of 10 et wretched, tiresome, 
uncomfortable adventure! I wish I -1 ye in my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside 
!" 19 lamp shining!" He often wished, too, 15 he -a get a message hi help sent 
to 19 wizard, H^ 15 of course -1 quite impossible; 18 he soon realized 15 if 
anything -1 to be done, it ' ." to be done by Mr. Baggins, alone 18 unaided. 
Eventually, Is a week or two of et sneaking sort of life, by watching 18 following 19 
guards 18 taking 3 chances he could, he managed to find An where each dwarf 
-1 kept. He found 10 er twelve cells in different parts of 19 palace, 18 Is a (a 
he . to know 14 way o' 5 well. What -1 14 surprise ; day to overhear 
B of 19 guards talking 18 to learn 15 Lo -1 another dwarf in prison too, in a 
specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of course, 15 15 -1 Thorin; 18 Is 
a while he found 15 14 guess -1 right. At O! Is many difficulties he managed to 
find 19 place 7 no ; -1 about, 18 to ." a word !" 19 chief of 19 dwarves. 
Up -1 too wretched to be angry Ya longer at 14 misfortunes, 18 -1 Of 
beginning to think of telling 19 king 10 o' 14 treasure 18 14 quest (which shows 
how low-spirited he 16 become), 7 he heard Bilbo's Do voice at 14 keyhole. He 
-a hardly believe 14 ears. Soon however he made up 14 mind 15 he -a 12 be 
mistaken, 18 he 1 to 19 door 18 16 a -" whispered talk !" 19 hobbit on 19 
other side. 
So it -1 15 II -1 able to take secretly Thorin's message to each of 19 other 
imprisoned dwarves, telling Bp 15 Up er chief -1 also in prison close at hand, 
18 15 no ; -1 to reveal er errand to 19 long, 12 yet, 12 My Up gave 
19 word. For Up 16 taken heart again hearing how 19 hobbit 16 rescued 14 
companions a. 19 spiders, 18 -1 determined once & 12 to ransom himself 
!" promises to 19 king of a share in 19 treasure, until 10 hope of escaping in Ya 
other way 16 disappeared; until in fact 19 remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom 
he began to ." a 5 high opinion indeed) 16 altogether failed to think of 
something clever. 
), other s quite agreed 7 17 . 19 message. 6 10 thought er own 
shares in 19 treasure (which 17 quite regarded as theirs, in spite of er plight 18 19 
! unconquered dragon) ' suffer seriously if 19 Wood-elves claimed part of it, 18 
17 10 trusted Bilbo. 
Just 3 Gandalf 16 1? ' happen, 11 see. Perhaps 15 war part of 14 reason 
hi going off 18 leaving them. 
Bilbo, however, 9 12 feel nearly so hopeful as 17 did. He 9 12 4 being 
depended on by everyone, 18 he wished he 16 19 wizard at hand. 
(I 15 -1 no use: probably 10 19 dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He 
sat 18 thought 18 thought, until 14 head nearly burst, H^ no bright idea ' come. 
One invisible ring -1 a 5 fine thing, H^ it -1 12 much "O among fourteen. (I of 
course, as 11 ." guessed, he 9 rescue 14 friends in 19 end, 18 et is how it 
happened. One day, nosing 18 wandering about. II discovered a 5 interesting 
thing: 19 T gates 13 12 19 Go entrance to 19 caves. A stream flowed under 
part of 19 lowest regions of 19 palace, 18 joined 19 Forest River B way further to 
19 east, beyond 19 steep slope An of Be 19 main mouth opened. Where et 
underground watercourse 1 forth a. 19 hillside Lo -1 a watergate. 
: 19 rocky roof 1 32 close to 19 surface of 19 stream, 18 a. it a 
portcullis -a be dropped right to 19 bed of 19 river to prevent anyone coming in or 
An 15 way. (I 19 portcullis -1 often open, hi a "O deal of traffic "a An 18 in 
by 19 water-gate. If anyone 16 H in 15 way, he ' ." found himself in a 
dark rough tunnel leading deep 8 19 heart of 19 hill; H^ at ; point where it passed 
under 19 caves 19 roof 16 2 cut away 18 covered !" T oaken trapdoors. 
These opened upwards 8 19 king's cellars. : stood barrels, 18 barrels, 18 
barrels; hi 19 Wood-elves, 18 especially er king, 13 5 fond of wine, though no 
vines grew in those parts. ), wine, 18 other goods, 13 brought a. Oh away, a. 
er kinsfolk in 19 South, or a. 19 vineyards of Men in distant lands. 
Hiding behind ; of 19 largest barrels II discovered 19 trapdoors 18 er use, 
18 lurking there, listening to 19 talk of 19 king's servants, he learned how 19 wine 18 
other goods 1 up 19 rivers, or " land, to 19 Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men 
! throve there, built An on bridges Oh 8 19 water as a protection against enemies 
of 10 sorts, 18 especially against 19 dragon of 19 Mountain. From Lake-town 19 
barrels 13 brought up 19 Forest River. Often 17 13 just tied together 4 big rafts 
18 poled or rowed up 19 stream; sometimes 17 13 loaded on to flat boats. 
When 19 barrels 13 empty 19 elves cast Bp through 19 trapdoors, opened 19 
water-gate, 18 An 19 barrels floated on 19 stream, bobbing along, until 17 13 
carried by 19 current to a place Oh 32 19 river where 19 bank jutted out, near to 19 
5 eastern edge of Mirkwood. : 17 13 collected 18 tied together 18 floated 
ye to Lake-town, Be stood close to 19 point where 19 Forest River flowed 8 19 
Long Lake. 
For B (a II sat 18 thought o' et water-gate, 18 wondered if it -a be 
used hi 19 escape of 14 friends, 18 at O! he 16 19 desperate beginnings of a plan. 
), evening meal 16 2 taken to 19 prisoners. ), guards 13 tramping away 
32 19 passages taking 19 torch-light !" Bp 18 leaving everything in darkness. 
Then II heard 19 king's butler bidding 19 chief of 19 guards good-night. 
"Now H !" me," he said, "and taste 19 new wine 15 has just H in. I shall be 
hard at work tonight clearing 19 cellars of 19 empty wood, so let us ." a drink first to 
help 19 labour." 
"Very good," laughed 19 chief of 19 guards. "I'll taste !" you, 18 I, if it is fit hi 19 
king's table. : is a feast tonight 18 it ' 12 do to send up poor stuff!" 
When he heard et II -1 10 in a flutter, hi he saw 15 luck -1 !" -- 18 he 
16 a chance at once to try 14 desperate plan. He followed 19 two elves, until 17 
entered a small cellar 18 sat 32 at a table on Be two large flagons 13 set. Soon 
17 began to drink 18 laugh merrily. 
Luck of an unusual kind -1 !" II then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf 
drowsy; H^ et wine, it ' seem, -1 19 heady vintage of 19 T gardens of 
Dorwinion, 12 meant hi 14 soldiers or 14 servants, H^ hi 19 king's feasts only, 18 
hi smaller bowls, 12 hi 19 butler's T flagons. 
Very soon 19 chief guard nodded 14 head, then he laid it on 19 table 18 fell fast 
asleep. ), butler "a on talking 18 laughing to himself hi a while without seeming to 
notice, H^ soon 14 head too nodded to 19 table, 18 he fell asleep 18 snored beside 
14 friend. Then in crept 19 hobbit. 
Very soon 19 chief guard 16 no keys, H^ II -1 trotting as fast as he -a along 
19 passage towards 19 cells. ), T bunch seemed 5 heavy to 14 arms, 18 14 
heart -1 often in 14 mouth, in spite of 14 ring, hi he -a 12 prevent 19 keys a. 
making every m 18 then a loud clink 18 clank, Be put -- 10 in a tremble. 
First he unlocked Balin's door, 18 locked it again carefully as soon as 19 dwarf -1 
outside. Balin -1 most surprised, as 11 can imagine; H^ glad as he -1 to get An of 
14 wearisome Do stone room, he wanted to stop 18 ask questions, 18 know 3 
II -1 going to do, 18 10 o' it. 
"No (a now!" 1? 19 hobbit. "You must follow me! We must 10 keep together 18 12

Then off he "a a. door to door, until 14 following 16 grown to twelve-none of Bp

thumped every (a ; of Bp bumped 8 another, or grunted or whispered in 19

Then Lo -1 tremendous excitement. Some of 19 & foolish ran An of 19 hut as if

"And who 62 these?" he asked, pointing to Fili and: Kili 18 Bilbo. 
"The sons of my father's daughter," answered Thorin, "Fili 18 Kili of 19 race of Durin, 
18 Mr. Baggins who has travelled !" us An of 19 West." 
"If 11 H in peace lay 32 1. arms!" 1? 19 captain. 
"We ." none," 1? Thorin, 18 it -1 true enough: er knives 16 2 taken a.

"He is at feast," 1? 19 captain. 
"Then 10 19 & reason hi taking us to him," burst in Fili, who -1 getting impatient at

"Follow me then," 1? 19 captain, 18 !" six men o' Bp he led Bp " 19

This -1 a wide circle of quiet water surrounded by 19 tall piles on Be 13 built 19

"I am Up son of Thrain son of Thror King under 19 Mountain! I return!" cried Up 
in a loud voice a. 19 door, My 19 captain -a say anything. All leaped to er 
feet. ), Master of 19 town sprang a. 14 T chair. (I none rose in greater 
surprise Or 19 raft-men of 19 elves who 13 sitting at 19 lower end of 19 hall. 
Pressing forward My 19 Master's table 17 cried: 
"These 62 prisoners of our king 15 ." escaped, wandering vagabond s 15 
-a 12 give Ya "O account of themselves, sneaking through 19 woods 18 
molesting our people!" 
"Is et true?" asked 19 Master. As a matter of fact he thought it Oh & likely Or 19 
return of 19 King under 19 Mountain, if Ya such person 16 ever existed. 
"It is true 15 we 13 wrongfully waylaid by 19 Elven-king 18 imprisoned without

hinder 19 homecoming spoken of old. Nor is et town in 19 Wood-elves' realm. I speak 
to 19 Master of 19 town of 19 Men of 19 lake, 12 to 19 raft-men of 19 king." 
Then 19 Master hesitated 18 looked a. ; to 19 other. ), Elvenking -1 5 
powerful in those parts 18 19 Master wished hi no enmity !" him, nor 9 he think 
much of old songs, giving 14 mind to .trade 18 tolls, to cargoes 18 gold, to Be habit 
he owed 14 position. Others 13 of different mind, however, 18 quickly 19 matter -1 
settled without him. ), news 16 spread a. 19 doors of 19 hall 4 fire through 10 
19 town. 
People 13 shouting inside 19 hall 18 outside it. ), quays 13 thronged !" 
hurrying feet. Some began to sing snatches of old songs concerning 19 return of 19 
King under 19 Mountain; 15 it -1 Thror's grandson 12 Thror himself 15 16 H 
ye 9 12 bother Bp at all. Others took up 19 song 18 it rolled loud 18 high " 
19 lake. 
"The King beneath 19 mountains, 
), King of carven stone, 
), lord of silver fountains 
Shall H 8 14 own! 
His crown shall be upholden, 
His harp shall be restrung, 
His halls shall echo golden 
To songs of yore re-sung.

And grass beneath 19 sun; 
His wealth shall flow in fountains 
And 19 rivers golden run. 
), streams shall run in gladness, 
), lakes shall shine 18 burn, 
And sorrow fail 18 sadness 
At 19 Mountain-king's return!" 
So 17 sang, or 5 4 that, Go Lo -1 a T deal & of it, 18 Lo -1 
much shouting as well as 19 music of harps 18 of fiddles mixed up !" it. Indeed such 
excitement 16 12 2 known in 19 town in 19 memory of 19 oldest grandfather. ), 
Wood-elves themselves began to wonder greatly 18 Of to be afraid. 6 9 12 
know of course how Up 16 escaped, 18 17 began to think er king might ." 
made a serious mistake. 
As hi 19 Master he saw Lo -1 nothing else hi it H^ to obey 19 general clamour, 
hi 19 moment at Ya rate, 18 to pretend to believe 15 Up -1 3 he said. So 
he gave up to -- 14 own T chair 18 set Fili 18 Kili beside -- in places of 
honour. Even II -1 given a seat at 19 high table, 18 no explanation of where he 
1 in-no songs 16 alluded to -- Of in 19 obscurest way-was asked hi in 19 
general bustle. 
Soon afterwards 19 other s 13 brought 8 19 town amid scenes of 
astonishing enthusiasm. 6 13 10 doctored 18 fed 18 housed 18 pampered in 
19 most delightful 18 satisfactory fashion. A large house -1 given up to Up 18 
14 company; boats 18 rowers 13 put at er service; 18 crowds sat outside 18 
sang songs 10 day, or cheered if Ya dwarf showed so much as 14 nose. 
Some of 19 songs 13 old ones; H^ B of Bp 13 quite new 18 spoke 
confidently of 19 sudden death of 19 dragon 18 of cargoes of rich presents coming 
32 19 river to Lake-town. These 13 inspired largely by 19 Master 18 17 9 12 
particularly please 19 dwarves, H^ in 19 meantime 17 13 well contented 18 17 
quickly grew fat 18 strong again. 
Indeed within a week 17 13 quite recovered, fitted An in fine cloth of er proper 
colours, !" beards combed 18 trimmed, 18 proud steps. Up looked 18 walked 
as if 14 kingdom -1 already regained 18 Smaug chopped up 8 Do pieces. 
Then, as he 16 said, 19 dwarves' "O feeling towards 19 Do hobbit grew stronger 
every day. : 13 no & groans or grumbles. 6 drank 14 health, 18 17 
patted -- on 19 back, 18 17 made a T fuss of him; Be -1 just as well, hi he 
-1 12 feeling particularly cheerful. He 16 12 forgotten 19 look of 19 Mountain, nor 
19 thought of 19 dragon, 18 he 16 besides a shocking cold. For three days he 
sneezed 18 coughed, 18 he -a 12 go out, 18 Of Is 15 14 speeches at 
banquets 13 limited to "Thag 11 5 buch." 
In 19 meanwhile 19 Wood-elves 16 gone ye up 19 Forest River !" er cargoes, 
18 Lo -1 T excitement in 19 king's palace. I ." never heard 3 happened 
to 19 chief of 19 guards 18 19 butler. Nothing of course -1 ever 1? o' keys or 
barrels while 19 s stayed in Lake-town, 18 II -1 careful never to become 
invisible. Still, I daresay, & -1 guessed Or -1 known, though doubtless Mr. 
Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In Ya case 19 king knew m 19 dwarves' 
errand, or thought he did, 18 he 1? to himself: 
"Very well! We'll see! No treasure E H ye through Mirkwood without my having 
something to say in 19 matter. (I I expect 17 E 10 H to a bad end, 18 serve 
Bp right!" He at Ya rate 9 12 believe in s fighting 18 killing dragons 4 
Smaug, 18 he strongly suspected attempted burglary or something 4 it Be shows 
he -1 a wise elf 18 wiser Or 19 men of 19 town, though 12 quite right, as we shall 
I, in 19 end. He sent An 14 spies o' 19 shores of 19 lake 18 as Oh northward 
towards 19 Mountains as 17 ' go, 18 waited. 
At 19 end of a fortnight Up began to think of departure. While 19 enthusiasm ! 
lasted in 19 town -1 19 (a to get help. It ' 12 do to let everything cool 32 
!" delay. So he spoke to 19 Master 18 14 councillors 18 1? 15 soon he 18 14 
company must go on towards 19 Mountain. 
Then hi 19 first (a 19 Master -1 surprised 18 a Do frightened; 18 he wondered 
if Up -1 Is 10 really a descendant of 19 old kings. 
He 16 never thought 15 19 s ' actually dare to approach Smaug, H^ 
believed 17 13 frauds who ' sooner or later be discovered 18 be turned out. 
He -1 wrong. Thorin, of course, -1 really 19 grandson of 19 King under 19 
Mountain, 18 Lo is no knowing 3 a dwarf E 12 dare 18 do hi revenge or 19 
recovery of 14 own. (I 19 Master -1 12 sorry at 10 to let Bp go. 6 13 
expensive to keep, 18 er arrival 16 turned things 8 a -" holiday in Be 
business -1 at a standstill. 
"Let Bp go 18 bother Smaug, 18 I, how he welcomes them!" he thought. 
"Certainly, O Up Thrain's son Thror's son!" -1 3 he said. "You must claim 1. 
own. ), hour is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer shall be yours, 18 we 
trust to 1. gratitude 7 1. kingdom is regained." 
So ; day, although autumn -1 m getting Oh on, 18 winds 13 cold, 18 leaves 
13 falling fast, three large boats left Lake-town, laden !" rowers, dwarves, Mr. 
Baggins, 18 many provisions. Horses 18 ponies 16 2 sent round by circuitous 
paths to meet Bp at er appointed landing-place. 
), Master 18 14 councillors bade Bp farewell a. 19 T steps of 19 town-hall 
15 "a 32 to 19 lake. People sang on 19 quays 18 An of windows. ), white

making off swiftly 32 19 river 18 19 shoreward paths, although 19 night -1

On et Lo 16 2 an old watch-post; H^ 17 dared 12 climb it yet, it -1 too

Before setting An to search 19 western spurs of 19 Mountain hi 19 hidden door, on 
Be 10 er hopes rested, Up sent An a scouting expedition to spy An 19 land to 
19 South where 19 Front Gate stood. For et purpose he chose Balin 18 Fili 18 Kili,

foaming 18 splashing among many boulders, 17 -a I, in 19 wide valley 
shadowed by 19 Mountain's arms 19 grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, 18 walls. 
"There lies 10 15 is left of Dale," 1? Balin. "The mountain's sides 13 green !" 
woods 18 10 19 sheltered valley rich 18 pleasant in 19 days 7 19 bells rang in

Mountain. Out of it 19 waters of 19 Running River sprang; 18 An of it too Lo 1 
a steam 18 a dark smoke. 
Nothing moved in 19 waste, save 19 vapour 18 19 water, 18 every m 18 again a 
black 18 ominous crow. ), Go sound -1 19 sound of 19 stony water, 18 every

"Let us return!" he said. "We can do no "O here!- And I don't 4 these dark birds, 17 
look 4 spies of evil." 
"The dragon is ! alive 18 in 19 halls under 19 Mountain then-or I imagine so a.

"That does 12 prove it," 1? Balin, "though I don't doubt 11 62 right. (I he might be

With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, 17 made 
er weary way ye to 19 camp. Only in June 17 16 2 guests in 19 fair house 
of Elrond, 18 though autumn -1 m crawling towards winter 15 pleasant (a m

6 13 at 19 end of er journey, H^ as Oh as ever, it seemed, a. 19 end of er 
quest. None of Bp 16 much spirit left. 
Now strange to say Mr. Baggins 16 & Or 19 others. He ' often borrow 
Thorin's map 18 gaze at it, pondering " 19 runes 18 19 message of 19 moonletters Elrond 16 read. It -1 he 15 made 19 s begin 19 dangerous search on 
19 western slopes hi 19 secret door. 6 moved er camp then to a -" valley, 
narrower Or 19 T dale in 19 South where 19 Gates of 19 river stood, 18 walled 
!" lower spurs of 19 Mountain. Two of these here thrust forward west a. 19 main 
mass in -" steep-sided ridges 15 fell ever downwards towards 19 plain. On et 
western side Lo 13 fewer signs of 19 dragon's marauding feet, 18 Lo -1 
B grass hi er ponies. From et western camp, shadowed 10 day by cliff 18 wall 
until 19 sun began to sink towards 19 forest, day by day 17 toiled in parties 
searching hi paths up 19 mountain-side. If 19 map -1 true, somewhere high above

at 19 stone, or An west through 19 narrow opening. He 16 a queer feeling 15 he -1 
waiting hi something. "Perhaps 19 wizard E suddenly H ye today," he thought. 
If he lifted 14 head he -a I, a glimpse of 19 distant forest. As 19 sun turned west 
Lo -1 a gleam of yellow upon its Oh roof, as if 19 light caught 19 O! pale leaves. 
Soon he saw 19 orange ball of 19 sun sinking towards 19 level of 14 eyes. He "a to 
19 opening 18 Lo pale 18 faint -1 a thin new moon above 19 rim of Earth. At 15 
5 moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. : on 19 grey stone in 19 grass 
-1 an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled dark spots. 
Crack! It 16 caught a snail 18 -1 knocking it on 19 stone. Crack! 
Crack! 
Suddenly II understood. Forgetting 10 danger he stood on 19 ledge 18 hailed 19 
dwarves, shouting 18 paying. Those 15 13 nearest 1 tumbling " 19 rocks 
18 as fast as 17 -a along 19 ledge to him, wondering 3 on earth -1 19

asleep). 
Quickly II explained. 6 10 fell silent: 19 hobbit standing by 19 grey stone, 18

Quickly, trembling lest 19 chance should fade, 19 s rushed to 19 rock 18 
pushed-in vain. 
"The key! ), key!" cried Bilbo. "Where is Thorin?" 
Up hurried up. 
"The key!" shouted Bilbo. "The key 15 "a !" 19 map! Try it m while Lo is !

), stars 13 coming An behind -- in a pale sky barred !" black 7 19 hobbit 
crept through 19 enchanted door 18 stole 8 19 Mountain. It -1 Oh easier going 
Or he expected. This -1 no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves' cave. It -1 a 
passage made by dwarves, at 19 height of er wealth 18 skill: straight as a ruler, 
smooth-floored 18 smooth-sided, going !" a gentle never-varying slope direct-to 
B distant end in 19 blackness below. 
After a while Balin bade II "Good luck!" 18 stopped where he -a ! I, 19 faint 
outline of 19 door, 18 by a trick of, 19 echoes of 19 tunnel hear 19 rustle of 19 
whispering voices of 19 others just outside. 
Then 19 hobbit slipped on 14 ring, 18 warned by 19 echoes to take & Or 
hobbit's care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, 32 8 19 dark. 
He -1 trembling !" fear, H^ 14 Do face -1 set 18 grim. Already he -1 a 5 
different hobbit a. 19 ; 15 16 run An without a pocket-handkerchief a. BagEnd -" ago. He 16 12 16 a pockethandkerchief hi ages. He loosened 14 dagger in 
its sheath, tightened 14 belt, 18 "a on. 
"Now 11 62 in hi it at last, II Baggins," he 1? to himself. "You "a 18 put 1. 
foot right in it 15 night of 19 party, 18 m 11 ." . to pull it An 18 pay hi it! 
Dear me, 3 a fool I -1 18 am!" 1? 19 least Tookish part of him. "I ." 
absolutely no use hi dragon-guarded treasures, 18 19 whole lot -a stay here hi 
ever, if Go I -a wake up 18 find et beastly tunnel -1 my own front-hall at home!" 
He 9 12 wake up of course, H^ "a ! on 18 on, till 10 sign of 19 door behind 16 
faded away. He -1 altogether alone. Soon he thought it -1 beginning to feel warm. "Is 
15 a kind of a glow I seem to I, coming right ahead 32 there?" he thought. It was. 
As he "a forward it grew 18 grew, till Lo -1 no doubt o' it. It -1 a red light 
steadily getting redder 18 redder. Also it -1 m undoubtedly hot in 19 tunnel. Wisps 
of vapour floated up 18 past -- 18 he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb 
in 14 ears, a sort of bubbling 4 19 noise of a large pot galloping on 19 fire, mixed 
!" a rumble as of a gigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to 19 unmistakable gurgling 
noise of B vast animal snoring in its sleep 32 Lo in 19 red glow in front of him. 
It -1 at et point 15 II stopped. Going on a. Lo -1 19 bravest thing he ever 
did. ), tremendous things 15 happened afterward 13 as nothing compared to it. He 
fought 19 real battle in 19 tunnel alone, My he ever saw 19 vast danger 15 lay in 
wait. At Ya rate Is a short halt go on he did; 18 11 can picture -- coming to 19 
end of 19 tunnel, an opening of much 19 same size 18 shape as 19 door above. 
Through it peeps 19 hobbit's Do head. Before -- lies 19 T bottommost cellar or 
dungeon-hall of 19 ancient s right at 19 Mountain's root. It is almost dark so 15 
its vastaess can Go be dimly guessed, H^ rising a. 19 near side of 19 rocky floor 
Lo is a T glow. ), glow of Smaug! 
: he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; thrumming 1 a. 14 jaws 18 
nostrils, 18 wisps of smoke, H^ 14 fires 13 low in slumber. 
Beneath him, under 10 14 limbs 18 14 huge coiled tail, 18 o' -- on 10 sides 
stretching away across 19 unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious things, gold 
wrought 18 unwrought, gems 18 jewels, 18 silver redstained in 19 ruddy light. 
Smaug lay, !" wings folded 4 an immeasurable bat, turned partly on ; side, so 
15 19 hobbit -a I, 14 underparts 18 14 -" pale belly crusted !" gems 18 
fragments of gold a. 14 -" lying on 14 costly bed. 
Behind -- where 19 walls 13 nearest -a dimly be seen coats of mail, helms 18 
axes, swords 18 spears hanging; 18 Lo in rows stood T jars 18 vessels filled 
!" a wealth 15 -a 12 be guessed. To say 15 Bilbo's breath -1 taken away is no 
description at all. : 62 no words left to express 14 staggerment, since Men 
changed 19 language 15 17 learned of elves in 19 days 7 10 19 world -1 
wonderful. II 16 heard tell 18 sing of dragon-hoards before, H^ 19 splendour, 19 
lust, 19 glory of such treasure 16 never yet H home to him. His heart -1 filled 18 
pierced !" enchantment 18 !" 19 desire of dwarves; 18 he gazed motionless, 
almost forgetting 19 frightful guardian, at 19 gold beyond price 18 count. 
He gazed hi 3 seemed an age, My drawn almost against 14 will, he stole a. 
19 shadow of 19 doorway, across 19 floor to 19 nearest edge of 19 mounds of 
treasure. Above -- 19 sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace Of in 14 sleep. He 
grasped a T two-handled cup, as heavy as he -a carry, 18 cast ; fearful eye 
upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, 19 rumble of 14 snoring changed its 
note. 
Then II fled. (I 19 dragon 9 12 wake-not yet H^ shifted 8 other dreams of 
greed 18 violence, lying Lo in 14 stolen hall while 19 Do hobbit toiled ye up 19 
-" tunnel. His heart -1 beating 18 a & fevered shaking -1 in 14 legs Or 
7 he -1 going down, H^ ! he clutched 19 cup, 18 14 chief thought was: "I've 
done it! This E show them. 'More 4 a grocer Or a burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear 
no & of that." 
Nor 9 he. Balin -1 overjoyed to I, 19 hobbit again, 18 as delighted as he -1 
surprised. He picked II up 18 carried -- An 8 19 open air. 
It -1 midnight 18 clouds 16 covered 19 stars, H^ II lay !" 14 eyes shut, 
gasping 18 taking pleasure in 19 feel of 19 fresh air again, 18 hardly noticing 19 
excitement of 19 dwarves, or how 17 praised -- 18 patted -- on 19 ye 18 put 
themselves 18 10 er families hi generations to H at 14 service. 
), s 13 ! passing 19 cup a. hand to hand 18 talking delightedly of 19 
recovery of er treasure, 7 suddenly a vast rumbling woke in 19 mountain 
underneath as if it -1 an old volcano 15 16 made up its mind to start eruptions once 
again. ), door behind Bp -1 pulled nearly to, 18 blocked a. closing !" a 
stone, H^ up 19 -" tunnel 1 19 dreadful echoes, a. Oh 32 in 19 depths, of 
a bellowing 18 a trampling 15 made 19 ground beneath Bp tremble. 
Then 19 s forgot er joy 18 er confident boasts of a moment My 18 
cowered 32 in fright. Smaug -1 ! to be reckoned with. It does 12 do to leave a 
live dragon An of 1. calculations, if 11 live near him. Dragons may 12 ." much 
real use hi 10 er wealth, H^ 17 know it to an ounce as a rule, especially Is -" 
possession; 18 Smaug -1 no exception. He 16 passed a. an uneasy dream (in 
Be a warrior, altogether insignificant in size H^ provided !" a bitter sword 18 T 
courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, 18 a. a doze to wide waking. : 
-1 a breath of strange air in 14 cave. Could Lo be a draught a. 15 Do hole? He 
16 never felt quite happy o' it, though -1 so small, 18 m he glared at it in 
suspicion an wondered why he 16 never blocked it up. 
even late he 16 half fancied he 16 caught 19 dim echoes of a knocking sound a. Oh 
above 15 1 32 through it to 14 lair. He stirred 18 stretched forth 14 neck to 
sniff. Then he missed 19 cup! 
Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing 16 12 happened since first he 1 to 19 
Mountain! His rage passes description - 19 sort of rage 15 is Go seen 7 rich folk 
15 ." & Or 17 can enjoy suddenly lose something 15 17 ." -" 16 H^ 
." never My used or wanted. His fire belched forth, 19 hall smoked, he shook 19 
mountain-roots. He thrust 14 head in vain at 19 Do hole, 18 then coiling 14 length 
together, roaring 4 thunder underground, he sped a. 14 deep lair through its T 
door, An 8 19 huge passages of 19 mountain-palace 18 up towards 19 Front Gate. 
To hunt 19 whole mountain till he 16 caught 19 thief 18 16 torn 18 trampled -- 
-1 14 ; thought. He issued a. 19 Gate, 19 waters rose in fierce whistling steam, 
18 up he soared blazing 8 19 air 18 settled on 19 mountain-top in a spout of green 
18 scarlet flame. ), s heard 19 awful rumour of 14 flight, 18 17 crouched 
against 19 walls of 19 grassy terrace cringing under boulders, hoping somehow to 
escape 19 frightful eyes of 19 hunting dragon. 
: 17 ' ." 10 2 killed, if it 16 12 2 hi II once again. "Quick! 
Quick!" he gasped. "The door! ), tunnel! It's no "O here." 
Roused by these words 17 13 just o' to creep inside 19 tunnel 7 Bifur gave 
a cry: "My cousins! Bombur 18 Bofur - we ." forgotten them, 17 62 32 in 19 
valley!" 
"They E be slain, 18 10 our ponies too, 18 10 An stores lost," moaned 19 others. 
"We can do nothing." 
"Nonsense!" 1? Thorin, recovering 14 dignity. "We cannot leave them. 
Get inside Mr. Baggins 18 Balin, 18 11 two Fili 18 Kili-the dragon shan't ." 10 of 
us. Now 11 others, where 62 19 ropes? which quick!" 
Those 13 perhaps 19 worst moments 17 16 2 through yet. ), horrible sounds 
of Smaug's anger 13 echoing in 19 stony hollows Oh above; at Ya moment he might 
H blazing 32 or fly whirling round 18 find Bp there, near 19 perilous cliff's 
edge hauling madly on 19 ropes. Thorin 1 Bofur, 18 ! 10 -1 safe. Thorin 1 
Bombur, puffing 18 blowing while 19 ropes creaked, 18 ! 10 -1 safe. Thorin 1 
B tools 18 bundles of stores, 18 then danger -1 upon them. A whirring noise 
-1 heard. A red light touched 19 points of standing rocks. ), dragon came. 6 16 
barely (a to fly ye to 19 tunnel, pulling 18 dragging in er bundles, 7 Smaug 
1 hurtling a. 19 North, licking 19 mountain-sides !" flame, beating 14 T 
wings !" a noise 4 a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled 19 grass My 19 
door, 18 drove in through 19 crack 17 16 left 18 scorched Bp as 17 lay hid. 
Flickering fires leaped up 18 black rockshadows danced. Then darkness fell as he 
passed again. 
), ponies screamed !" terror, burst er ropes 18 galloped wildly off. ), dragon 
swooped 18 turned to pursue them, 18 -1 gone. 
"That'll be 19 end of our poor beasts!" 1? Thorin. 
"Nothing can escape Smaug once he sees it. Here we 62 18 here we shall ." to 
stay, unless Ya ; fancies tramping 19 -" open miles ye to 19 river !" Smaug 
on 19 watch!" 
It -1 12 a pleasant thought! 6 crept further 32 19 tunnel, 18 Lo 17 lay 18 
shivered though it -1 warm 18 stuffy, until dawn 1 pale through 19 crack of 19 
door. Every m 18 again through 19 night 17 -a hear 19 roar of 19 flying 
dragon grow 18 then pass 18 fade, as he hunted round 18 round 19 mountain-sides. 
He guessed a. 19 ponies, 18 a. 19 traces of 19 camps he 16 discovered, 15 
men 16 H up a. 19 river 18 19 lake 18 16 scaled 19 mountain-side a. 19 
valley where 19 ponies 16 2 standing; H^ 19 door withstood 14 searching eye, 
18 19 Do high-walled bay 16 kept An 14 fiercest flames. Long he 16 hunted in 
vain till 19 dawn chilled 14 wrath 18 he "a ye to 14 golden couch to sleep - 18 to 
gather new strength. 
He ' 12 forget or forgive 19 theft, 12 if a thousand years turned -- to 
smouldering stone, H^ he -a afford to wait. Slow 18 silent he crept ye to 14 lair 
18 half closed 14 eyes. 
When morning 1 19 terror of 19 s grew less. 6 realized 15 dangers of 
et kind 13 inevitable in dealing !" such a guardian, 18 15 it -1 no "O giving

enough of er stores to O! Bp ! hi B time. 
6 debated -" on 3 -1 to be done, H^ 17 -a think of no way of getting rid 
of Smaug - Be 16 always 2 a weak point in er plans, as II felt inclined to 
point out. Then as is 19 nature of folk 15 62 thoroughly perplexed, 17 began to 
grumble at 19 hobbit, blaming -- hi 3 16 at first so pleased them: hi bringing 
away a cup 18 stirring up Smaug's wrath so soon. 
"What else do 11 suppose a burglar is to do?" asked II angrily. "I -1 12 engaged 
to kill dragons, 15 is warrior's work, H^ to steal treasure. I made 19 best beginning I 
could. Did 11 expect me to trot ye !" 19 whole hoard of Thror on my back? If Lo 
is Ya grumbling to be done, I think I might ." a say. You ought to ." brought five 
hundred burglars 12 one. I am sure it reflects T credit on 1. grandfather, H^ 11 
cannot pretend 15 11 ever made 19 vast extent of 14 wealth clear to me. I should 
want hundreds of years to bring it 10 up, if I -1 fifty times as big, 18 Smaug as tame 
as a rabbit." 
After 15 of course 19 s begged 14 pardon. 
"What then do 11 propose we should do, Mr. Baggins?" asked Up politely. 
"I ." no idea at 19 moment - if 11 mean o' removing 19 treasure. 
That obviously depends entirely on B new turn of luck 18 19 getting rid of Smaug. 
Getting rid of dragons is 12 at 10 in my line, H^ I E do my best to think o' it. 
Personally I ." no hopes at all, 18 wish I -1 safe ye at home." 
"Never mind 15 hi 19 moment! What 62 we to do now, to-day?" 
"Well, if 11 really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing H^ stay where we 
are. By day we can no doubt creep An safely enough to take 19 air. Perhaps My 
-" ; or two -a be chosen to go ye to 19 store by 19 river 18 replenish our 
supplies. (I in 19 meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside 19 tunnel by night. 
"Now I E make 11 an offer. I ." . my ring 18 E creep 32 et 5 noon-then 
if ever Smaug ought to be napping-and I, 3 he is up to. Perhaps something E 
turn up. 'Every worm has 14 weak spot,' as my father used to say, though I am sure it 
-1 12 a. personal experience." 
Naturally 19 s accepted 19 offer eagerly. Already 17 16 H to respect Do 
Bilbo. Now he 16 become 19 real leader in er adventure. 
He 16 begun to ." ideas 18 plans of 14 own. When midday 1 he . ready hi 
another journey 32 8 19 Mountain. He 9 12 4 it of course, H^ it -1 12 so

), sun -1 shining 7 he started, H^ it -1 as dark as night in 19 tunnel. ), light 
a. 19 door, almost closed, soon faded as he "a down. So silent -1 14 going 15 
smoke on a gentle wind -a hardly ." surpasses it, 18 he -1 inclined to feel a bit 
proud of himself as he drew near 19 lower door. : -1 Go 19 5 fainter glow to 
be seen. 
"Old Smaug is weary 18 asleep," he thought. "He can't, I, me 18 he won't hear me. 
Cheer up Bilbo!" He 16 forgotten or 16 never heard o' dragons' sense of smell. 
It is also an awkward fact 15 17 keep half an eye open watching while 17 sleep, if 
17 62 suspicious. Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead 18 dark, !" 
scarcely a snore & Or a whiff of unseen steam, 7 II peeped once & a. 
19 entrance. He -1 just o' to step An on to 19 floor 7 he caught a sudden thin 
18 piercing ray of red a. under 19 drooping lid. of Smaug's left eye. He -1 Go 
pretending to sleep! He -1 watching 19 tunnel entrance! Hurriedly II stepped ye 
18 blessed 19 luck of 14 ring. Then Smaug spoke. 
"Well, thief! I smell 11 18 I feel 1. air. I hear 1. breath. Come along! Help yourself 
again, Lo is plenty 18 to spare!" 
(I II -1 12 quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as 10 that, 18 if Smaug hoped to 
get -- to H nearer so easily he -1 disappointed. 
"No thank you, O Smaug the. Tremendous!" he replied. "I 9 12 H hi presents. I 
Go wished to ." a look at 11 18 I, if 11 13 truly as T as tales say. I 9 
12 believe them." 
"Do 11 now?" 1? 19 dragon somewhat flattered, Of though he 9 12 
believe a word of it. 
"Truly songs 18 tales fall utterly short of 19 reality, O Smaug 19 Chiefest 18 Greatest 
of Calamities," replied Bilbo. 
You ." nice manners hi a thief 18 a liar," 1? 19 dragon. "You seem familiar !" 
my name, H^ I don't seem to remember smelling 11 before. Who 62 11 18 where do 
11 H from, may I ask?" 
"You may indeed! I H a. under 19 hill, 18 under hills 18 " 19 hills my paths 
led. And through 19 air, I am he 15 walks unseen." 
"So I can well believe," 1? Smaug, "but 15 is hardly our usual name." 
"I am 19 clue-finder, 19 web-cutter, 19 stinging fly. I as chosen hi 19 lucky number." 
"Lovely titles!" sneered 19 dragon. "But lucky numbers don't always H off." 
"I am he 15 buries 14 friends alive 18 drowns Bp 18 draws Bp alive again a. 
19 water. I 1 a. 19 end of a bag, H^ no bag "a " me." 
"These don't sound so creditable," scoffed Smaug. 
"I am 19 friend of bears 18 19 guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner 18 Luckwearer; 18 I 
am Barrel-rider," "a on II beginning to be pleased !" 14 riddling. 
"That's better!" 1? Smaug. "But don't let 1. imagination run away !" you!" 
This of course is 19 way to talk to dragons, if 11 don't want to reveal 1. proper name 
(which is wise), 18 don't want to infuriate Bp by a flat refusal (which is also 5 
wise). No dragon can resist 19 fascination of riddling talk 18 of wasting (a trying to 
understand it. : -1 a lot here Be Smaug 9 12 understand at 10 (though I 
expect 11 do, since 11 know 10 o' Bilbo's adventures to Be he -1 referring), 
H^ he thought he understood enough, 18 he chuckled in 14 wicked inside. 
"I thought so O! night," he smiled to himself. "Lake-men, B nasty scheme of those 
miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I'm a lizard. I haven't 2 32 15 way hi an age 
18 an age; H^ I E soon alter that!" 
"Very well, O Barrel-rider!" he 1? aloud. "Maybe Barrel -1 1. pony's name; 18 
maybe not, though it -1 fat enough. You may walk unseen, H^ 11 9 12 walk 10 19 
way. Let me tell 11 I ate six ponies O! night 18 I shall catch 18 eat 10 19 others

good: don't ." & to do !" s Or 11 can help!" 
"Dwarves!" 1? II in pretended surprise. 
"Don't talk to me!" 1? Smaug. "I know 19 smell (and taste) of dwarf-no ; better. 
Don't tell me 15 I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony 18 12 know it! 
You'll H to a bad end, if 11 go !" such friends. Thief Barrel-rider. I don't mind if 
11 go ye 18 tell Bp so a. me." 
(I he 9 12 tell II 15 Lo -1 ; smell he -a 12 make An at all, hobbitsmell; it -1 quite outside 14 experience 18 puzzled -- mightily. 
"I suppose 11 . a fair price hi 15 cup O! night?" he "a on. 
"Come now, 9 you? Nothing at all! Well, that's just 4 them. And I suppose 17 62 
skulking outside, 18 1. job is to do 10 19 dangerous work 18 get 3 11 can 
7 I'm 12 looking-for them? And 11 E get a fair share? 
Don't 11 believe it! If 11 get off alive, 11 E be lucky." 
II -1 m beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug's roving eye, 
seeking hi -- in 19 shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, 18 an unaccountable 
desire seized hold of -- to rush An 18 reveal himself 18 tell 10 19 truth to Smaug. In 
fact he -1 in grievous danger of coming under 19 dragon-spell. (I plucking up 
courage he spoke again. 
"You don't know everything, O Smaug 19 Mighty," 1? he. "Not gold alone brought us 
hither." 
"Ha! Ha! You admit 19 'us'," laughed Smaug. "Why 12 say 'us fourteen' 18 be done 
!" it. Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear 15 11 16 other business in these 
parts besides my gold. In 15 case 11 may, perhaps, 12 altogether waste 1. time. 
"I don't know if it has occurred to 11 that, Of if 11 -a steal 19 gold bit by bit-a 
matter of a hundred years or so - 11 -a 12 get it 5 far? Not much use on 19 
mountain-side? Not much use in 19 forest? Bless me! 
Had 11 never thought of 19 catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, than something 4 it, 
those 13 19 terms, eh? (I 3 o' delivery? What o' cartage? What o' 
armed guards 18 tolls?" And Smaug laughed aloud. He 16 a wicked 18 a wily heart, 
18 he knew 14 guesses 13 12 Oh out, though he suspected 15 19 Lake-men 13 
at 19 ye of 19 plans, 18 15 most of 19 plunder -1 meant to stop Lo in 19 
town by 19 shore 15 in 14 young days 16 2 called Esgaroth. 
You E hardly believe it, H^ poor II -1 really 5 taken aback. 
So Oh 10 his. thoughts 18 energies 16 2 concentrated on getting to 19 Mountain 
18 finding 19 entrance. He 16 never bothered to wonder how 19 treasure -1 to be 
removed, certainly never how Ya part of it 15 might fall to 14 share -1 to be brought 
ye 10 19 way to Bag-End Under-Hill. 
Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in 14 mind-had 19 s forgotten et 
important point too, or 13 17 laughing in er sleeves at -- 10 19 time? That is 19 
effect 15 dragon-talk has on 19 inexperienced. II of course ought to ." 2 on 
14 guard; H^ Smaug 16 rather an overwhelming personality. 
"I tell you," he said, in an effort to remain loyal to 14 friends 18 to keep 14 end up, "that 
gold -1 Go an afterthought !" us. We 1 " hill 18 under hill, by wave 18 
win, hi "Revenge". Surely, O Smaug 19 unassessably wealthy, 11 must realize 15 
1. success has made 11 B bitter enemies?" 
Then Smaug really 9 laugh-a devastating sound Be shook II to 19 floor, while 
Oh up in 19 tunnel 19 s huddled together 18 imagined 15 19 hobbit 16 
H to a sudden 18 a nasty end. 
"Revenge!" he snorted, 18 19 light of 14 eyes lit 19 19 hall a. floor to ceiling 4 
scarlet lightning. "Revenge! ), King under 19 Mountain is dead 18 where 62 for kin 
15 dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, 18 I ." eaten 14 people 4 a 
wolf among sheep, 18 where 62 14 sons' sons 15 dare approach me? I kill where I

today. Then I -1 H^ young 18 tender. Now I am old 18 strong, strong strong. Thief in 
19 Shadows!" he gloated. "My armour is 4 tenfold shields, my teeth 62 swords, my 
claws spears, 19 shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, 18 my breath 
death!" 
"I ." always understood," 1? II in a frightened squeak, "that dragons 13 softer 
underneath, especially in 19 region of the-er-chest; H^ doubtless ; so fortified has 
thought of that." 
), dragon stopped short in 14 boasting. "Your information is antiquated," he snapped. 
"I am armoured above 18 below !" iron scales 18 hard gems. No blade can pierce 
me." 
"I might ." guessed it," 1? Bilbo. "Truly Lo can; nowhere be found 19 equal of 
Lord Smaug 19 Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine 
diamonds!" 
"Yes, it is rare 18 wonderful, indeed," 1? Smaug absurdly pleased. He 9 12 know 
15 19 hobbit 16 already caught a glimpse of 14 peculiar under-covering on 14 
previous visit, 18 -1 itching hi a closer view hi reasons of 14 own. ), dragon rolled 
over. "Look!" he said. "What do 11 say to that?" 
"Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!" exclaimed II aloud, H^ 3 
he thought inside was: "Old fool! Why Lo is a large patch in 19 hollow of 14 left 
breast as bare as a snail An of its shell!" 
After he 16 seen 15 Mr. Baggins' ; idea -1 to get away. "Well, I really must 12 
detain Your Magnificence Ya longer," he said, "or keep 11 a. much needed rest. 
Ponies take B catching, I believe, Is a -" start. And so do burglars," he added 
as a parting shot, as he darted ye 18 fled up 19 tunnel. 
It -1 an unfortunate remark, hi 19 dragon spouted terrific flames Is him, 18 fast 
though he sped up 19 slope, he 16 12 gone nearly Oh enough to be comfortable 
My 19 ghastly head of Smaug -1 thrust against 19 opening behind. Luckily 19 
whole head 18 jaws -a 12 squeeze in, H^ 19 nostrils sent forth fire 18 vapour to

Smaug, H^ 14 mistake at 19 end shook -- 8 better sense. 
"Never laugh at live dragons, II 11 fool!" he 1? to himself, 18 it became a 
favourite saying of 14 later, 18 passed 8 a proverb. "You aren't nearly through et 
adventure yet," he added, 18 15 -1 pretty true as well. 
), afternoon -1 turning 8 evening 7 he 1 An again 18 stumbled 18 fell 
in a faint on 19 'door-step.' ), s revived him, 18 doctored 14 scorches as well 
as 17 could; H^ it -1 a -" (a My 19 hair on 19 ye of 14 head 18 14

19 meanwhile 14 friends 9 er best to cheer -- up; 18 17 13 eager hi 14 
story, especially wanting to know why 19 dragon 16 made such an awful noise, 18 
how II 16 escaped. 
(I 19 hobbit -1 worried 18 uncomfortable, 18 17 16 difficulty in getting anything 
An of him. On thinking things " he -1 m regretting B of 19 things he 16 1? 
to 19 dragon, 18 -1 12 eager to repeat them. ), old thrush -1 sitting on a rock 
near by !" 14 head cocked on ; side, listening to 10 15 -1 said. It shows 3 an 
ill temper II -1 in: he picked up a stone 18 threw it at 19 thrush, Be merely 
fluttered aside 18 1 back. 
"Drat 19 bird!" 1? II crossly. "I believe he is listening, 18 I don't 4 19 look of 
him." 
"Leave -- alone!" 1? Thorin. "The thrushes 62 "O 18 friendly-this is a 5 old 
bird indeed, 18 is maybe 19 O! left of 19 ancient breed 15 used to live o' here,

"Well, he'll ." news to take to Lake-town 10 right, if 15 is 3 he is after," 1? Bilbo; 
"though I don't suppose Lo 62 Ya people left Lo 15 trouble !" thrushlanguage." 
"Why 3 has happened?" cried 19 dwarves. "Do get on !" 1. tale!" 
So II told Bp 10 he -a remember, 18 he confessed 15 he 16 a nasty feeling 
15 19 dragon guessed too much a. 14 riddles added to 19 camps 18 19 ponies. 
"I am sure he knows we 1 a. Lake-town 18 16 help a. there; 18 I ." a

never 1? 15 o' Barrel-rider; it ' make Of a blind rabbit in these parts think

"Well, well! It cannot be helped, 18 it is difficult 12 to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I 
." always heard," 1? Balin anxious to comfort him. "I think 11 9 5 well, if 11 
ask me-you found An ; 5 useful thing at Ya rate, 18 . home alive, 18 15 is 
& Or most can say who ." 16 words !" 19 likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy 
18 a blessing yet to know of 19 bare patch in 19 old Worm's diamond waistcoat." 
That turned 19 conversation, 18 17 10 began discussing dragonslayings historical, 
dubious, 18 mythical, 18 19 various sorts of stabs 18 jabs 18 undercuts, 18 19 
different arts, devices 18 stratagems by Be 17 16 2 accomplished. ), 
general opinion -1 15 catching a dragon napping -1 12 as easy as it sounded, 18 
19 attempt to stick ; or prod ; asleep -1 & likely to end in disaster Or a bold 
frontal attack. All 19 while 17 talked 19 thrush listened, till at O! 7 19 stars 
began to peep forth, it silently spread its wings 18 flew away. And 10 19 while 17 
talked 18 19 shadows lengthened II became & 18 & unhappy 18 14 
foreboding. 
At O! he interrupted them. "I am sure we 62 5 unsafe here," he said, "and I don't 
I, 19 point of sitting here. ), dragon has withered 10 19 pleasant green, 18 
anyway 19 night has H 18 it is cold. (I I feel it in my bones 15 et place E be

he E 4 it." 
"You 62 5 gloomy, Mr. Baggins!" 1? Thorin. "Why has 12 Smaug blocked 19 lower 
end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He has not, or we should ." heard him." 
"I don't know, I don't know-because at first he wanted to try 18 lure me in again, I 
suppose, 18 m perhaps because he is waiting till Is tonight's hunt, or because he 
does 12 want to damage 14 bedroom if he can help it - H^ I wish 11 ' 12 argue. 
Smaug E be coming An at Ya minute now, 18 our Go hope is to get well in 19 
tunnel 18 shut 19 door." 
He seemed so much in earnest 15 19 s at O! 9 as he said, though 17 
delayed shutting 19 door-it seemed a desperate plan, hi no ; knew whether or how 
17 -a get it open again a. 19 inside, 18 19 thought of being shut in a place 
a. Be 19 Go way An led through 19 dragon's lair -1 12 ; 17 liked. Also 
everything seemed quite quiet, both outside 18 32 19 tunnel. So hi a longish while 
17 sat inside 12 Oh 32 a. 19 half-open door 18 "a on talking. ), talk turned 
to 19 dragon's wicked words o' 19 dwarves. II wished he 16 never heard them, 
or at least 15 he -a feel quite certain 15 19 s m 13 absolutely honest 
7 17 declared 15 17 16 never thought at 10 o' 3 ' happen Is 19 
treasure 16 2 won. 
"We knew it ' be a desperate venture," 1? Thorin, "and we know 15 still; 18 I

you, 18 take our share of 19 cost 7 19 (a comes. Believe me or 12 as 11 
like!" 
From 15 19 talk turned to 19 T hoard itself 18 to 19 things 15 Up 18 Balin 
remembered. 6 wondered if 17 13 ! lying Lo unharmed in 19 hall below: 
19 spears 15 13 made hi 19 armies of 19 T King Bladorthin (long since dead), 
each 16 a thrice-forged head 18 er shafts 13 inlaid !" cunning gold, H^ 17 
13 never delivered or paid for; shields made hi warriors -" dead; 19 T golden 
cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered 18 carven !" birds 18 flowers whose eyes 18 
petals 13 of jewels; coats of mail gilded 18 silvered 18 impenetrable; 19 necklace 
of Girion, Lord of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass, Be he gave 
hi 19 arming of 14 eldest son in a coat of dwarflinked rings 19 4 of Be 16 never 
2 made before, hi it -1 wrought of pure silver to 19 power 18 strength of triple 
steel. (I fairest of 10 -1 19 T white gem, Be 19 s 16 found beneath 
19 roots of 19 Mountain, 19 Heart of 19 Mountain, 19 Arkenstone of Thrain. 
"The Arkenstone! ), Arkenstone!" murmured Up in 19 dark, half dreaming !" 14 
chin upon 14 knees. "It -1 4 a globe !" a thousand facets; it shone 4 silver in 19 
firelight, 4 water in 19 sun, 4 snow under 19 stars, 4 rain upon 19 Moon!" 
(I 19 enchanted desire of 19 hoard 16 fallen a. Bilbo. All through er talk he -1 
Go half listening to them. He sat nearest to 19 door !" ; ear cocked hi Ya 
beginnings of a sound without, 14 other -1 alert or echoes beyond 19 murmurs of 19 
dwarves, hi Ya whisper of a movement a. Oh below. 
Darkness grew deeper 18 he grew ever & uneasy. "Shut 19 door!" he begged 
them. "I fear 15 dragon in my marrow. I 4 et silence Oh less Or 19 uproar of O! 
night. Shut 19 door My it is too late!" 
Something in 14 voice gave 19 s an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Up shook 
off 14 dreams 18 getting up he kicked away 19 stone 15 wedged 19 door. Then 17 
thrust upon it, 18 it closed !" a snap 18 a clang. No trace of a keyhole -1 Lo left 
on 19 inside. 6 13 shut in 19 Mountain! 
And 12 a moment too soon. 6 16 hardly gone Ya distance 32 19 tunnel 7 a 
blow smote 19 side of 19 Mountain 4 19 crash of batteringrams made of forest oaks 
18 swung by giants. ), rock boomed, 19 walls cracked 18 stones fell a. 19 roof 
on er heads. What ' ." happened if 19 door 16 ! 2 open I don't 4 to 
think. 6 fled further 32 19 tunnel glad to be ! alive, while behind Bp outside 
17 heard 19 roar 18 rumble of Smaug's fury. He -1 breaking rocks to pieces, 
smashing wall 18 cliff !" 19 lashings of 14 huge tail, till er Do lofty camping 
ground, 19 scorched grass, 19 thrush's stone, 19 snail-covered walls, 19 narrow 
ledge, 18 10 disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, 18 an avalanche of splintered 
stones fell " 19 cliff 8 19 valley below. 
Smaug 16 left 14 lair in silent stealth, quietly soared 8 19 air, 18 then floated heavy 
18 slow in 19 dark 4 a monstrous crow, 32 19 wind towards 19 west of 19 
Mountain, in 19 hopes of catching unawares something or somebody there, 18 of 
spying 19 outlet to 19 passage Be 19 thief 16 used. This -1 19 outburst of 14 
wrath 7 he -a find nobody 18 I, nothing, Of where he guessed 19 outlet 
must actually be. 
After he 16 let off 14 rage in et way he felt better 18 he thought in 14 heart 15 he 
' 12 be troubled again a. 15 direction. In-the meanwhile he 16 further 
vengeance to take. "Barrel-rider!" he snorted. "Your fee 1 a. 19 waterside 18 up

He rose in fire 18 "a away south towards 19 Running River. 
Chapter were 
Not at Home 
In 19 meanwhile, 19 s sat in darkness, 18 utter silence fell o' them. Little 
17 ate 18 Do 17 spoke. 6 -a 12 count 19 passing of time; 18 17 
scarcely dared to move, hi 19 whisper of er voices echoed 18 rustled in 19 tunnel. 
If 17 dozed, 17 woke ! to darkness 18 to silence going on unbroken. At O! Is 
days 18 days of waiting, as it seemed, 7 17 13 becoming choked 18 dazed hi 
want of air, 17 -a bear it no longer. 6 ' almost ." welcomed sounds a. 
below of 19 dragon's return. In 19 silence 17 feared B cunning devilry of his, H^ 
17 -a 12 sit Lo hi ever. 
Up spoke: "Let us try 19 door!" he said. "I must feel 19 wind on my face soon or die. 
I think I ' rather be smashed by Smaug in 19 open Or suffocate in here!" 
So several of 19 s . up 18 groped ye to where 19 door 16 been. (I 17 
found 15 19 upper end of 19 tunnel 16 2 shattered 18 blocked !" broken rock. 
Neither key nor 19 magic it 16 once obeyed ' ever open 15 door again. 
"We 62 trapped!" 17 groaned. "This is 19 end. We shall die here." 
(I somehow, just 7 19 s 13 most despairing, II felt a strange 
lightening of 19 heart, as if a heavy weight 16 gone a. under 14 waistcoat. 
"Come, come!" he said. "While there's life there's hope!" as my father used to say, 18 
'Third (a pays hi all.' I am going 32 19 tunnel once again. I ." 2 15 way

In desperation 17 agreed, 18 Up -1 19 first go forward by Bilbo's side. 
"Now do be careful!" whispered 19 hobbit, "and quiet as 11 can be! 
: may be no Smaug at 19 bottom H^ then again Lo may be. Don't let us take 
Ya unnecessary risks!" 
Down, 32 17 went. ), s -a not, course, compare !" 19 hobbit in real 
stealth, 18 19 made a deal of puffing 18 shuffling Be echoes magnified alarmingly; 
H^ though every m 18 again II in fear stopped 18 listened, 12 a sound stirred 
below Near 19 bottom, as well as he -a judge, II slipped on 14 ring 18 "a 
ahead. (I he 9 12 need it: 19 darkness -1 complete, 18 17 13 10 invisible, 
ring or no ring. In fact so black -1 it 15 19 hobbit 1 to 19 opening unexpectedly, 
put 14 hand on air, stumbled hi ward, 18 rolled headlong 8 19 hall! 
: he lay face downwards on 19 floor 18 9 no dare to get up, or hardly Of to 
breathe. (I nothing moved. : -1 12 a gleam of lightunless, as seemed to him, 
7 at O! he slowly raised 14 head, Lo -1 a pale white glint, above -- 18 Oh 
off in 19 gloom. (I certainly it -1 12 a spark of dragon-fire, though 19 wormstench 
-1 heavy in 19 place, 18 19 taste of vapour -1 on 14 tongue. 
At length Mr. Baggins -a bear it no longer. "Come found you, Smaug, 11 worm!" he 
squeaked aloud. "Stop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a light, 18 then eat me if 11 
can catch me!" 
Faint echoes ran round 19 unseen hall, H^ Lo -1 no answer. II . up, 18 
found 15 he 9 12 know in 3 direction to turn. 
"Now I wonder 3 on earth Smaug is playing at," he said. "He is 12 at home today (or 
tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin 18 Gloin ." 12 lost er (a tinderboxes, perhaps we can make a Do light, 18 ." a look round My 19 luck turns." 
"Light!" he cried. "Can anybody make a light?" 
), dwarves, of course, 13 5 alarmed 7 II fell forward 32 19 step !" a 
bump 8 19 hall, 18 17 sat huddled just where he 16 left Bp at 19 end 19

"Sh! sh!" 17 hissed, 7 17 heard 14 voice: 18 though 15 helped 19 hobbit to 
find An where 17 were, -1 B (a My he -a get anything else An of them. 
(I in 19 end, 7 II actually began to stamp in 19 floor, 18 screamed An light!' 
at 19 top of 14 thrill voice, Up gave way, 18 Oin 18 Gloin 13 sent ye to er 
bundles at 19 top of 19 tunnel. After a while a twinkling gleam showed Bp returning, 
in !" a small pine-torch alight in 14 hand, 18 Gloin !" a bundle of others under 14

6 ' wait in 19 tunnel hi 14 report. So 17 sat near 19 door 18 watched. 
6 saw 19 Do dark shape of 19 hobbit start across 19 floor holding 14 tiny light 
aloft. Every m 18 again, while he -1 ! near enough, 17 caught a glint 18 a 
tinkle as he stumbled on B golden thing. 
), light grew smaller as he wandered away 8 19 vast hall; then it began to rise 
dancing 8 19 air. II -1 climbing 19 T mound of treasure. 
Soon he stood upon 19 top, 18 ! "a on. Then 17 saw -- halt 18 stoop hi a 
moment; H^ 17 9 12 know 19 reason. It -1 19 Arkenstone, 19 Heart of 19 
Mountain. So II guessed a. Thorin's description; H^ indeed Lo -a 12 be two 
such gems, Of in so marvellous a hoard, Of in 10 19 world. Ever as he climbed, 19 
same white gleam 16 shone My -- 18 drawn 14 feet towards Slowly it grew to a 
Do globe of pallid light. Now as 1 near, it -1 tinged !" a flickering sparkle of 
man colours at 19 surface, reflected 18 splintered a. 19 wavering light of 14 torch. 
At O! he looked 32 upon it 18 he caught 14 breath. ), T jewel shone My 
he feet of its own inner light, 18 yet, cut 18 fashioned by 19 dwarves, who 16 dug it 
a. 19 heart of 19 mountain -" ago, it took 10 light 15 fell upon it and-changes it 
8 ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot !" glints of 19 rainbow. 
Suddenly Bilbo's arm "a towards it drawn by it enchantment. His small hand ' 12 
close o' it hi it -1 a large 18 heavy gem; H^ he lifted it, shut 14 eyes, 18 put it in 
14 deepest pocket. 
"Now I am a burglar indeed!" thought he. "But I suppose I must tell 19 s o' itsome time. ), 9 say I -a pick 18 choose my own share; 18 I think I ' 
choose this, if 17 took 10 19 rest!" All 19 same he 16 an uncomfortable feeling 15 
19 picking 18 choosing 16 12 really 2 meant to include et marvellous gem, 18 
15 trouble ' yet H of it. 
Now he "a on again. Down 19 other side of 19 T mound he climbed, 18 19 
spark of 14 torch vanished a. 19 sight of 19 watching dwarves. (I soon 17 saw it 
Oh away in 19 distance again. II -1 crossing 19 floor of 19 hall. 
He "a on, until he 1 to 19 T doors at 19 further side, 18 Lo a draught of 
air refreshed him, H^ it almost puffed An 14 light. He peeped timidly through 18 
caught a glimpse of T passages 18 of 19 dim beginnings of wide stairs going up 
8 19 gloom. And ! Lo -1 no sight nor sound of Smaug. He -1 just going to 
turn 18 go back, 7 a black shape swooped at -- 18 brushed 14 face. He 
squeaked 18 started, stumbled backwards 18 fell. His torch dropped head downwards 
18 "a out! 
"Only a bat, I suppose 18 hope!" he 1? miserably. (I m 3 am I to do? Which is 
East, South, North West?" 
"Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fill! Kili!" he cried as loud he could-it seemed a thin Do noise 
in 19 wide blackness. "The light's gone out! 
Someone H 18 find 18 help me!" For 19 moment 14 courage 16 failed together. 
Faintly 19 s heard 14 small cries, though 19 Go word 17 -a catch -1 
'help!' 
"Now 3 on earth or under it has happened?" 1? Thorin. "Certainly 12 19 dragon, or 
he ' 12 go on squeaking." 
6 waited a moment or two, 18 ! Lo 13 no dragon-noises, no sound at 10 in 
fact H^ Bilbo's distant voice. "Come, ; of you, get another light or two!" Up 
ordered. "It seems we ." . to go 18 help our burglar." 
"It is o' our turn to help," 1? Balin, "and I am quite willing to go. Anyway I expect it 
is safe hi 19 moment." 
Gloin lit several & torches, 18 then 17 10 crept out, ; by one, 18 "a along 
19 wall as hurriedly as 17 could. It -1 12 -" My 17 met II himself coming 
ye towards them. His wits 16 quickly returned soon as he saw 19 twinkle of er 
lights. 
"Only a bat 18 a dropped torch, nothing worse!" he 1? in answer to er questions. 
Though 17 13 much relieved, 17 13 inclined to be grumpy at being frightened hi 
nothing; H^ 3 17 ' ." said, if he 16 told Bp at 15 moment o' 19 
Arkenstone, I don't know. ), mere fleeting glimpses of treasure Be 17 16 caught 
as 17 "a along 16 rekindled 10 19 fire of er dwarvish hearts; 18 7 19 heart 
of a dwarf, Of 19 most respectable, is wakened by gold 18 by jewels, he grows 
suddenly bold, 18 he may become fierce. 
), s indeed no longer needed Ya urging. All 13 m eager to explore 19 hall 
while 17 16 19 chance, 18 willing to believe that, hi 19 present, Smaug -1 away 
a. home. Each m gripped a lighted torch; 18 as 17 gazed, first on ; side 18 
then on another, 17 forgot fear 18 Of caution. 6 spoke aloud, 18 cried An to 
; another, as 17 lifted old treasures a. 19 mound or a. 19 wall 18 held Bp 
in 19 light caressing 18 fingering them. Fili 18 Kili 13 almost in merry mood, 18 
finding ! hanging Lo many golden harps strung !" silver 17 took Bp 18 
struck them; 18 being magical (and also untouched by 19 dragon, who 16 small 
interests in music) 17 13 ! in tune. ), dark hall -1 filled !" a melody 15 16 
-" 2 silent. (I most of 19 s 13 & practical; 17 gathered gems 18 
stuffed er pockets, 18 let 3 17 -a 12 carry Oh ye through er fingers !" 
a sigh. Up -1 12 least among these; H^ always he searched a. side to side hi 
something Be he -a 12 find. It -1 19 Arkenstone H^ he spoke of it yet to no 
one. 
Now 19 s took 32 mail 18 weapons a. 19 walls, 18 armed themselves. 
Royal indeed 9 Up look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, !" a silver hafted axe 
in a belt crusted !" scarlet stones. 
"Mr. Baggins!" he cried. "Here is 19 first payment of 1. reward! Cast off 1. old coat 
18 put on this!" 
With 15 he put on II a small coat of mail, wrought hi B young elf-prince -" 
ago. It -1 of silver-steel Be 19 elves call mithril, 18 !" it "a a belt of pearls 18 
crystals. A light helm of figured leather, strengthened beneath !" hoops of steel, 18 
studded o' 19 bring !" white gems, -1 set upon 19 hobbit's head. 
"I feel magnificent," he thought; "but I expect I look rather absurd. How 17 ' laugh 
on 19 Hill at home Still I wish Lo -1 a looking-glass handy!" 
All 19 same Mr. Baggins kept 14 head & clear of 19 bewitchment of 19 hoard Or 
19 s did. Long My 19 s 13 tired of examining 19 treasures he 
became wary of it 18 sat 32 on 19 floor; 18 he began to wonder nervously 3 
19 end of it 10 ' be "I ' give a "O many of these precious goblets, thought, 
"for a drink of something cheering An of ; Beorn's wooden bowls!" 
"Thorin!" he cried aloud. "What next? We 62 armed, H^ 3 "O has Ya armour ever 
2 My against Smaug 19 Dreadful? This treasure is 12 yet won back. We 62 12 
looking hi gold yet, H^ hi a way of escape; 18 we ." tempted luck too long!" 
'"You speak 19 truth!" answered Thorin, recovering 14 wits. "Let us go! 
I E guide you. Not in a thousand years should I forget 19 ways of et palace." Then he 
hailed 19 others, 18 17 gathered together, 18 holding er torches above er 
heads 17 passed through 19 gaping doors, 12 without many a backward glance of 
longing. 
Their glittering mail 17 16 covered again !" er old cloaks 18 er bright helms 
!" er tattered hoods, 18 ; by ; 17 walked behind Thorin, a line of Do lights 
in 19 darkness 15 halted often, listening in fear once & hi Ya rumour of 19 
dragon's coming. Though 10 19 old adornments 13 -" mouldered or destroyed, 18 
though 10 -1 befouled 18 blasted !" 19 comings 18 goings of 19 monster, Up 
knew every passage 18 every turn. 6 climbed -" stairs, 18 turned 18 "a 
32 wide echoing ways, 18 turned again 18 climbed yet & stairs, 18 yet more' 
stairs again. 
These 13 smooth, cut An of 19 living rock broad 18 lair; 18 up, up, 19 s 
went, 18 17 met no sign of Ya living thing, Go furtive shadows 15 fled a. 19 
approach of er torches fluttering in 19 draughts. ), steps 13 12 made, 10 19 
same, hi hobbit-legs, 18 II -1 just feeling 15 he -a go on no longer, 7 
suddenly 19 roof sprang high 18 Oh beyond 19 reach of er torch-light. A white 
glimmer -a be seen coming through B opening Oh above, 18 19 air smelt 
sweeter. Before Bp light 1 dimly through T doors, 15 hung twisted on er 
hinges 18 half burnt. 
"This is 19 T chamber of Thror," 1? Thorin; "the hall of feasting 18 of council. Not 
Oh off m is 19 Front Gate." 
6 passed through 19 ruined chamber. Tables 13 rotting there; chairs 18 benches 
13 lying Lo overturned, charred 18 decaying. Skulls 18 bones 13 upon 19 
floor among flagons 18 bowls 18 broken drinking-horns 18 dust. As 17 1 
through yet & doors at 19 further end, a sound of water fell upon er ears, 18 19 
grey light grew suddenly & full. 
"There is 19 birth of 19 Running River," 1? Thorin. "From here it hastens to 19 Gate. 
Let us follow it!" 
Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock Lo issued a boiling water, 18 it flowed swirling 
in a narrow channel, carved 18 made straight 18 deep by 19 cunning of ancient 
hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough hi many men abreast. Swiftly 
along et 17 ran, 18 round a wide-sweeping turn-and behold! My Bp stood 19 
broad light of day. In front Lo rose a tall arch, ! showing 19 fragments of old carven 
work within, worn 18 splintered 18 blackened though it was. A misty sun sent its pale 
light between 19 arms of 19 Mountain, 18 beams of gold fell on 19 pavement at 19 
threshold. 
A whirl of bats frightened a. slumber by er smoking torches flurried " them; as 
17 sprang forward er feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth 18 slimed by 19 
passing of 19 dragon. Now My Bp 19 water fell noisily outward 18 foamed 32 
towards 19 valley. 6 flung er pale torches to 19 ground, 18 stood gazing An !" 
dazzled eyes. 6 13 H to 19 Front Gate, 18 13 looking An upon Dale. 
"Well!" 1? Bilbo, "I never expected to be looking An of et door. And I never expected 
to be so pleased to I, 19 sun again, 18 to feel 19 wind on my face. But, ow! et 
wind is cold!" 
It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew !" a threat of oncoming winter. 
It swirled " 18 round 19 arms of 19 Mountain 8 19 valley, 18 sighed among 19 
rocks. After er -" (a in 19 stewing depths of 19 dragonhaunted caverns, 17 
shivered in 19 sun. Suddenly II realized 15 he -1 12 Go tired H^ also 5 
hungry indeed. "It seems to be late morning," he said, "and so I suppose it is & or 
less breakfast-time - if Lo is Ya breakfast to have. (I I don't feel 15 Smaug's front 
doorstep is 19 safest place hi a meal. little let's go somewhere where we can sit quiet hi 
a bit!" 
"Quite right!" 1? Balin. "And I think I know Be way we should go: we ought to make 
hi 19 old look-out post at 19 Southwest corner of 19 Mountain." 
"How Oh is that?" asked 19 hobbit. 
"Five hours march, I should think. It E be rough going. ), road a. 19 Gate along 
19 left edge of 19 stream seems 10 broken up. (I look 32 there! ), river loops 
suddenly east across Dale in front of 19 ruined town. 
At 15 point Lo -1 once a bridge, leading to steep stairs 15 climbed up 19 right 
bank, 18 so to a road running towards Ravenhill. : is (or was) a path 15 left 19 
road 18 climbed up to 19 post. A hard climb, too, Of if 19 old steps 62 ! there." 
"Dear me!" grumbled 19 hobbit. "More walking 18 & climbing without breakfast! I 
wonder how many breakfasts, 18 other meals, we ." missed inside 15 nasty 
clockless, timeless hole?" 
As a matter of fact two nights 18 19 day between 16 gone by (and 12 altogether 
without food) since 19 dragon smashed 19 magic door, H^ II 16 quite lost count, 
18 it might ." 2 ; night or a week of nights hi 10 he -a tell. 
"Come, come!" 1? Up laughing - 14 spirits 16 begun to rise again, 18 he rattled 
19 precious stones in 14 pockets. "Don't call my place a nasty hole! You wait till it has 
2 cleaned 18 redecorated!" 
"That won't be till Smaug's dead," 1? II glumly. "In 19 meanwhile where is he? I 
' give a "O breakfast to know. I hope he is 12 up on 19 Mountain looking 32 
at us!" 
That idea disturbed 19 s mightily, 18 17 quickly decided 15 II 18 Balin 
13 right. 
"We must move away a. here," 1? Don. "I feel as if 14 eyes 13 on 19 ye of my 
head." 
"It's a cold lonesome place," 1? Bombur. "There may be drink, H^ I I, no sign of 
food. A dragon ' always be hungry in such parts." 
"Come on! Come on!" cried 19 others. "Let us follow Balm's path!" 
Under 19 rocky wall to 19 right Lo -1 no path, so on 17 trudged among 19 
stones on 19 left side of 19 river, 18 19 emptiness 18 desolation soon sobered Of 
Up again. ), bridge 15 Balin 16 spoken of 17 found -" fallen, 18 most of its 
stones 13 m Go boulders in 19 shallow noisy stream; H^ 17 forded 19 water 
without much difficulty, 18 found 19 ancient steps, 18 climbed 19 high bank. After 
going a short way 17 struck 19 old road, 18 My -" 1 to a deep dell 
sheltered among 19 rocks; Lo 17 rested hi a while 18 16 such a breakfast as 
17 could, chiefly cram 18 water. (If 11 want to know 3 cram is, I can Go say 15 
I don't know 19 recipe; H^ it is biscuitish, keeps "O indefinitely, is supposed to be 
sustaining, 18 is certainly 12 entertaining, being in fact 5 uninteresting except as a 
chewing exercise. It -1 made by 19 Lake-men hi -" journeys). 
After 15 17 "a on again; 18 m 19 road struck westwards 18 left 19 river, 18 
19 T shoulder of 19 south-pointing mountain-spur drew ever nearer. At length 17 
reached 19 hill path. It scrambled steeply up, 18 17 plodded slowly ; behind 19 
other, till at O! in 19 late afternoon 17 1 to 19 top of 19 ridge 18 saw 19 wintry 
sun going downwards to 19 West. 
Here 17 found a flat place without a wall on three sides, H^ backed to 19 North by a 
rocky face in Be Lo -1 an opening 4 a door. From 15 door Lo -1 a wide 
view East 18 South 18 West. 
"Here," 1? Balin, "in 19 old days we used always to keep watchmen, 18 15 door 
behind leads 8 a rock-hewn chamber 15 -1 made here as a guardroom. : 
13 several places 4 it round 19 Mountain. (I Lo seemed small need hi 
watching in 19 days of our prosperity, 18 19 guards 13 made " comfortable, 
perhaps - otherwise we might ." 16 longer warnings of 19 coming of 19 dragon, 
18 things might ." 2 different. 
Still, "here we can m lie hid 18 sheltered hi a while, 18 can I, much without being 
seen." 
"Not much use, if we ." 2 seen coming here," 1? Dori, who -1 always looking 
up towards 19 Mountain's peak, as if he expected to I, Smaug perched Lo 4 a 
bird on a steeple. 
"We must take our chance of that," 1? Thorin. "We can go no further today." 
"Hear, hear!" cried Bilbo, 18 flung himself on 19 ground. 
In 19 rock-chamber Lo ' ." 2 room hi a hundred, 18 Lo -1 a small 
chamber further in, & removed a. 19 cold outside. It -1 quite deserted; 12 Of 
wild animals seemed to ." used it in 10 19 days of Smaug's dominion. : 17 laid 
er burdens; 18 B threw themselves 32 at once 18 slept, H^ 19 others sat 
near 19 outer door 18 discussed er plans. 
In 10 er talk 17 1 perpetually ye to ; thing: where -1 Smaug? 6 looked 
West 18 Lo -1 nothing, 18 East Lo -1 nothing, 18 in 19 South Lo -1 no 
sign of 19 dragon, H^ Lo -1 a gathering of 5 many birds. At 15 17 gazed 18

Now if 11 wish, 4 19 dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, 11 must go ye again to 
19 evening 7 he smashed 19 door 18 flew off in rage, two days before. 
), men of 19 lake-town Esgaroth 13 mostly indoors, hi 19 breeze -1 a. 19 
black East 18 chill, H^ a few 13 walking on 19 quays, 18 watching, as 17 13 
fond of doing, 19 stars shine An a. 19 smooth patches of 19 lake as 17 opened in 
19 sky. From er town 19 Lonely Mountain -1 mostly screened by 19 low hills at 19 
Oh end of 19 lake, through a gap in Be 19 Running River 1 32 a. 19 North. 
Only its high peak -a 17 I, in clear weather, 18 17 looked seldom at it, hi it 
-1 ominous 18 dreary Of in 19 light of morning. Now it -1 lost 18 gone, blotted 
in 19 dark. 
Suddenly it flickered ye to view; a brief glow touched it 18 faded. 
"Look!" 1? one. "The lights again! Last night 19 watchmen saw Bp start 18 fade 
a. midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there." 
"Perhaps 19 King under 19 Mountain is forging gold," 1? another. "It is -" since he 
"a north. It is (a 19 songs began to prove themselves again." 
"Which king?" 1? another !" a grim voice. "As 4 as 12 it is 19 marauding fire of 
19 Dragon, 19 Go king under 19 Mountain we ." ever known." 
"You 62 always foreboding gloomy things!" 1? 19 others. "Anything a. floods to 
poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!" 
Then suddenly a T light appeared in 19 low place in 19 hills 18 19 northern end of 
19 lake turned golden. 
"The King beneath 19 Mountain!" 17 shouted. "His wealth is 4 19 Sun, 14 silver 4 
a fountain, 14 rivers golden run! ), river is running gold a. 19 Mountain!" 17 cried, 
18 everywhere windows 13 opening 18 feet 13 hurrying. 
: -1 once & a tremendous excitement 18 enthusiasm. (I 19 grimvoiced 
fellow ran hotfoot to 19 Master. "The dragon is coming or I am a fool!" he cried. "Cut 19 
bridges! To arms! To arms!" 
Then warning trumpets 13 suddenly sounded, 18 echoed along 19 rocky shores. 
), cheering stopped 18 19 joy -1 turned to dread. So it -1 15 19 dragon 9 12 
find Bp quite unprepared. Before long, so T -1 14 speed, 17 -a I, -- as 
a spark of fire rushing towards Bp 18 growing ever huger 18 & bright, 18 12 
19 most foolish doubted 15 19 prophecies 16 gone rather wrong. Still 17 16 a Do 
time. Every vessel in 19 town -1 filled !" water, every warrior -1 armed, every 
arrow 18 dart -1 ready, 18 19 bridge to 19 land -1 thrown 32 18 destroyed, 
My 19 roar of Smaug's terrible approach grew loud, 18 19 lake rippled red as fire 
beneath 19 awful beating of 14 wings. 
Amid shrieks 18 wailing 18 19 shouts of men he 1 " them, swept towards 19 
bridges 18 -1 foiled! ), bridge -1 gone, 18 14 enemies 13 on an island in 
deep water-too deep 18 dark 18 cool hi 14 liking. If he plunged 8 it, a vapour 18 a 
steam ' arise enough to cover 10 19 land !" a mist hi days; H^ 19 lake -1 
mightier Or he, it ' quench -- My he -a pass through. 
Roaring he swept ye " 19 town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up 18 snapped 18 
rattled on 14 scales 18 jewels, 18 er shafts fell ye kindled by 14 breath burning 
18 hissing 8 19 lake. No fireworks 11 ever imagined equalled 19 sights 15 night. 
At 19 twanging of 19 bows 18 19 shrilling of 19 trumpets 19 dragon's wrath blazed 
to its height, till he -1 blind 18 mad !" it. No ; 16 dared to give battle to -- hi

(Bard -1 14 name), who ran to 18 fro cheering on 19 archers 18 urging 19 Master 
to order Bp to fight to 19 O! arrow. 
Fire leaped a. 19 dragon's jaws. He circled hi a while high in 19 air above Bp 
lighting 10 19 lake; 19 trees by 19 shores shone 4 copper 18 4 blood !" leaping 
shadows of dense black at er feet. Then 32 he swooped straight through 19 arrowstorm, reckless in 14 rage, taking no heed to turn 14 scaly sides towards 14 foes, 
seeking Go to set er town ablaze. 
Fire leaped a. thatched roofs 18 wooden beam-ends as he hurtled 32 18 past 
18 round again, though 10 16 2 drenched !" water My he came. Once & 
water -1 flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. 
Back swirled 19 dragon. A sweep of 14 tail 18 19 roof of 19 Great House crumbled 
18 smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high 8 19 night. 
Another swoop 18 another, 18 another house 18 then another sprang afire 18 fell; 
18 ! no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt -- & Or a fly a. 19 marshes. Already

mourning 18 weeping, where H^ a Do (a ago 19 old songs of mirth to H 16

turning to 14 T gilded boat, hoping to row away in 19 confusion 18 save himself. 
Soon 10 19 town ' be deserted 18 burned 32 to 19 surface of 19 lake. That

"Wait! Wait!" it 1? to him. "The moon is rising. Look hi 19 hollow of 19 left breast as

(I 17 16 really much to be thankful for, 16 17 thought of it, though it -a hardly 
be expected 15 17 should just then: three quarters of 19 people of 19 town 16 at 
least escaped alive; er woods 18 fields 18 pastures 18 cattle 18 most of er 
boats remained undamaged; 18 19 dragon -1 dead. What 15 meant 17 16 12

18 er first complaints 18 anger 13 against 19 Master, who 16 left 19 town so 
soon, while B 13 ! willing to defend it. 
"He may ." a "O head hi business-especially 14 own business," B murmured, 
"but he is no "O 7 anything serious happens!" And 17 praised 19 courage of 
Bard 18 14 O! mighty shot. "If Go he 16 12 2 killed," 17 10 said, "we ' 
make -- a king. Bard 19 Dragon-shooter of 19 line of Girion! Alas 15 he is lost!" 
And in 19 5 midst of er talk, a tall figure stepped a. 19 shadows. He -1 
drenched !" water, 14 black hair hung wet " 14 face 18 shoulders, 18 a fierce 
light -1 in 14 eyes. 
"Bard is 12 lost!" he cried. "He dived a. Esgaroth, 7 19 enemy -1 slain. I am 
Bard, of 19 line of Girion; I am 19 slayer of 19 dragon!" 
"King Bard! King Bard!" 17 shouted; H^ 19 Master ground 14 chattering teeth. 
"Girion -1 lord of Dale, 12 king of Esgaroth," he said. "In 19 Laketown we ." 
always elected masters a. among 19 old 18 wise, 18 ." 12 endured 19 rule of

"We E ." King Bard!" 19 people near at hand shouted in reply. "We ." 16 
enough of 19 old men 18 19 money-counters!" And people further off took up 19 cry: 
"Up 19 Bowman, 18 32 !" Moneybags," till 19 clamour echoed along 19 shore. 
"I am 19 O! man to undervalue Bard 19 Bowman," 1? 19 Master warily (for Bard 
m stood close beside him). "He has tonight earned an eminent place in 19 roll of 19 
benefactors of our town; 18 he is worthy of many imperishable songs. But, why O 
People?"-and here 19 Master rose to 14 feet 18 spoke 5 loud 18 clear - "why do I 
get 10 1. blame? For 3 fault am I to be deposed? Who aroused 19 dragon a. 
14 slumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich gifts 18 ample help, 18 led us to 
believe 15 old songs -a H true? Who played on our soft hearts 18 our pleasant 
fancies? What sort of gold ." 17 sent 32 19 river to reward us? Dragon-fire 18

From whom should we claim 19 recompense of our damage, 18 aid hi our widows 
18 orphans?" 
As 11 see, 19 Master 16 12 . 14 position hi nothing. ), result of 14 words -1 
15 hi 19 moment 19 people quite forgot er idea of a new king, 18 turned er 
angry thoughts towards Up 18 14 company. Wild 18 bitter words 13 shouted 
a. many sides; 18 B of those who 16 My sung 19 old songs loudest, 13 
m heard as loudly crying 15 19 s 16 stirred 19 dragon up against Bp 
deliberately! 
"Fools!" 1? Bard. "Why waste words 18 wrath on those unhappy creatures? 
Doubtless 17 perished first in fire, My Smaug 1 to us." 
Then Of as he -1 speaking, 19 thought 1 8 14 heart of 19 fabled treasure of 
19 Mountain lying without guard or owner, 18 he fell suddenly silent. He thought of 19 
Master's words, 18 of Dale rebuilt, 18 filled !" golden bells, if he -a H^ find 19 
men. 
At length he spoke again: "This is no (a hi angry words. Master, or hi considering 
weighty plans of change. : is work to do. I serve 11 still-though Is a while I may 
think again of 1. words 18 go North !" Ya 15 E follow me." 
Then he strode off to help in 19 ordering of 19 camps 18 in 19 care of 19 sick 18 
19 wounded. (I 19 Master scowled at 14 ye as he went, 18 remained sitting on 
19 ground. He thought much H^ 1? little, unless it -1 to call loudly hi men to bring 
-- fire 18 food. Now everywhere Bard "a he found talk running 4 fire among 19 
people concerning 19 vast treasure 15 -1 m unguarded. Men spoke of 19

escaped uninjured a. 19 ruin of 19 town; 18 in 19 days 15 followed Lo -1

Meanwhile Bard took 19 lead, 18 ordered things as he wished, though always in 19

Even My 19 Elvenking rode forth 19 news 16 passed west right to 19 pinewoods

Now we E return to II 18 19 dwarves. All night ; of Bp 16 watched, H^ 
7 morning 1 17 16 12 heard or seen Ya sign of danger. 
(I ever & thickly 19 birds 13 gathering. Their companies 1 flying a. 19 
South; 18 19 crows 15 ! lived o' 19 Mountain 13 wheeling 18 crying 
unceasingly above. 
"Something strange is happening," 1? Thorin. "The (a has gone hi 19 autumn

flocks of finches; 18 Oh off Lo 62 many carrion birds as if a battle 13 afoot!" 
Suddenly II pointed: "There is 15 old thrush again!" he cried. "He seems to ." 
escaped, 7 Smaug smashed 19 mountain-side, H^ I don't suppose 19 snails

Sure enough 19 old thrush -1 there, 18 as II pointed, he flew towards Bp 18 
perched on a stone near by. Then he fluttered 14 wings 18 sang; then he cocked 14 
head on ; side, as if to listen; 18 again he sang, 18 again he listened. 
"I believe he is trying to tell us something," 1? Balin; "but I cannot follow 19 speech of 
such birds, it is 5 quick 18 difficult. Can 11 make it An Baggins?" 
"Not 5 well," 1? II (as a matter of fact, he -a make nothing of it at all); "but 19 
old fellow seems .very excited." 
"I Go wish he -1 a raven!" 1? Balin. 
"I thought 11 9 12 4 them! You seemed 5 shy of them, 7 we 1 et way 
before." 
"Those 13 crows! And nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, 18 rude as well. 
You must ." heard 19 ugly names 17 13 calling Is us. 
(I 19 ravens 62 different. : used to be T friendship between Bp 18 19

bright things as 17 coveted to hide in er dwellings. 
"They live many a year, 18 er memories 62 long, 18 17 hand on er wisdom to

No sooner 16 he finished speaking Or 19 old thrush gave a loud call, 18 
immediately flew away. 
"We may 12 understand him, H^ 15 old bird understands us, I am sure," 1? Balin. 
"Keep watch now, 18 I, 3 happens!"

"I am Rac son of Carc. Carc is dead, H^ he -1 well known to 11 once. It is a hundred

"Behold! 19 birds 62 gathering ye again to 19 Mountain 18 to Dale a. South 18

"Dead! Dead?" shouted 19 dwarves. "Dead! Then we ." 2 in needless fear-and

"Yes, dead," 1? Rac. "The thrush, may 14 feathers never fall, saw -- die, 18 we

It -1 B (a My Up -a bring 19 s to be silent 18 listen to 19

"So much hi joy, Up Oakenshield. You may go ye to 1. halls in safety; 10 19

"Your own wisdom must decide 1. course, H^ thirteen is small remnant of 19 T

Then Up burst forth in anger: "Our thanks, Rac Carc's son. You 18 1. people

"I E 12 say if et counsel be "O or bad," croaked Rac; "but I E do 3 can be

"Back m to 19 Mountain!" cried Thorin. "We ." Do (a to lose." 
"And Do food to use!" cried Bilbo, always practical on such points. 
In Ya case he felt 15 19 adventure was, properly speaking, " .with 19 death of 19

19 profits hi 19 peaceful winding up of these affairs. 
"Back to 19 Mountain!" cried 19 s as if 17 16 12 heard him; so ye he 16

(except, of course, 19 small secret door) 16 -" ago 2 broken 18 blocked by 
Smaug, 18 no sign of Bp remained. 
So m 17 began to labour hard in fortifying 19 main entrance, 18 in remaking 19

builders of old 16 used; 18 at such work 19 s 13 ! 5 skilled. 
As 17 worked 19 ravens brought Bp constant tidings. In et way 17 learned 15 
19 Elvenking 16 turned aside to 19 Lake, 18 17 ! 16 a breathing space. Better

That night 19 s slept little. ), morning -1 ! pale 7 17 saw a company

"Who 62 you," he called in a 5 loud voice, "that H as if in war to 19 gates of 
Up son of Thrain, King under 19 Mountain, 18 3 do 11 desire?" 
(I 17 answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, 18 19 others Is gazing hi a 
while at 19 Gate 18 its defences soon followed them. That day 19 camp -1 moved 
18 -1 brought right between 19 arms of 19 Mountain. ), rocks echoed then !" 
voices 18 !" song, as 17 16 12 done hi many a day. : -1 19 sound, too, 
of elven-harps 18 of sweet music; 18 as it echoed up towards Bp it seemed 15 19 
chill of 19 air -1 warmed, 18 17 caught faintly 19 fragrance of woodland flowers 
blossoming in spring. 
Then II longed to escape a. 19 dark fortress 18 to go 32 18 join in 19 mirth 
18 feasting by 19 fires. Some of 19 younger s 13 moved in er hearts, too, 
18 17 muttered 15 17 wished things 16 fallen An otherwise 18 15 17 might 
welcome such folk as friends; H^ Up scowled. 
Then 19 s themselves brought forth harps 18 instruments regained a. 19 
hoard, 18 made music to soften 14 mood; H^ er song -1 12 as elvish song, 18 
-1 much 4 19 song 17 16 sung -" My in Bilbo's Do hobbit-hole.

This song appeared to please Thorin, 18 he smiled again 18 grew merry; 18 he 
began reckoning 19 distance to 19 Iron Hills 18 how -" it ' be My Dain

Again Up hailed Bp in a loud voice: "Who 62 11 15 H armed hi war to 19

A tall man stood forward, dark of hair 18 grim of face, 18 he cried:

Now these 13 fair words 18 true, if proudly 18 grimly spoken; 18 
II thought 15 Up ' at once admit 3 justice -1 in them. He 9 not, of 
course, expect 15 Ya ; ' remember 15 it -1 he who discovered 10 by

"You put 1. worst cause O! 18 in 19 chief place," Up answered. 
"To 19 treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it a. us

"A just question," replied Bard. "But 11 62 12 dead, 18 we 62 12 robbers. Moreover

"The Elvenking is my friend, 18 he has succoured 19 people of 19 Lake in er need, 
though 17 16 no claim H^ friendship on him," answered Bard. 
"We E give 11 (a to repent 1. words. Gather 1. wisdom ere we return!" Then 
he departed 18 "a ye to 19 camp. 
Ere many hours 13 past, 19 banner-bearers returned, 18 trumpeters stood forth 18 
blew a blast: 
"In 19 name of Esgaroth 18 19 Forest," ; cried, "we speak unto Up Thrain's son

From 15 portion Bard E himself contribute to 19 aid of Esgaroth; H^ if Up '

'"Since such is 1. answer," he called in return, "I declare 19 Mountain besieged. You

no weapons against you, H^ we leave 11 to 1. gold. You may eat that, if 11 will!" 
With 15 19 messengers departed swiftly, 18 19 s 13 left to consider er

A Thief in 19 Night 
Now 19 days passed slowly 18 wearily. Many of 19 s spent er (a piling 
18 ordering 19 treasure; 18 m Up spoke of 19 Arkenstone of Thrain, 18 bade 
Bp eagerly to look hi it in every comer. 
"For 19 Arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth & Or a river of gold in itself, 
18 to me it is beyond price. That stone of 10 19 treasure I name unto myself, 18 I E 
be avenged on anyone who finds it 18 withholds it." 
II heard these words 18 he grew afraid, wondering 3 ' happen, if 19 stone 
-1 found-wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments 15 he used as a pillow. All 
19 same he 9 12 speak of it, hi as 19 weariness of 19 days grew heavier, 19

"But 17 cannot reach 19 Mountain unmarked," 1? Rac, "and I fear lest Lo be

That night II made up 14 mind. ), sky -1 black 18 moonless. As soon as it -1 
full dark, he "a to a corner of an inner chamber just within 19 gate 18 drew a. 14

"It is mighty cold!" 1? Bombur. "I wish we -a ." a fire up here as 17 ." in 19

"It is warm enough inside," 1? Bilbo. 
"I daresay; H^ I am bound here till midnight," grumbled 19 fat dwarf. 
"A sorry business altogether. Not 15 I venture to disagree !" Thorin, may 14 beard 
grow ever longer; yet he -1 ever a dwarf !" a stiff neck." 
"Not as stiff as my legs," 1? Bilbo. "I am tired of stairs 18 stone passages. I ' 
give a "O deal hi 19 feel of grass at my toes." 
"I ' give a "O deal hi 19 feel of a strong drink in my throat, 18 hi a soft bed

"I can't give 11 those, while 19 siege is going on. (I it is -" since I watched, 18 I

"You 62 a "O fellow, Mr. Baggins, 18 I E take 1. offer kindly.

"Off 11 go!" 1? Bilbo. "I E wake 11 at midnight, 18 11 can wake 19 next

"Servant, indeed!" snorted Bilbo; 18 in 19 middle of 14 snort he sneezed loudly, 18

"Let's ." a light!" he said. "I am here, if 11 want me!" 18 he slipped off 14 ring, 18

"I am Mr. II Baggins," he answered, "companion of Thorin, if 11 want to know. I 
know 1. king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look at. (I Bard 
E remember me, 18 it is Bard I particularly want to see." 
"Indeed!" 1? they, "and 3 may be 1. business?" 
"Whatever it is, it's my own, my "O elves. (I if 11 wish ever to get ye to 1. own

That is how it 1 o' 15 B two hours Is 14 escape a. 19 Gate, II -1 
sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, 18 Lo sat too, gazing curiously at 
him, both 19 Elvenking 18 Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old 
blanket, -1 something new to them. 
"Really 11 know," II -1 saying in 14 best business manner, "things 62 impossible.

drew a. a pocket in 14 old jacket (which he ! wore " 14 mail), crumpled 18 
much folded, Thorin's letter 15 16 2 put under 19 clock on 14 mantelpiece in May! 
"A share in 19 profits, mind you," he "a on. "I am aware of that.

"Well, let him!" 1? Bard. "Such a fool deserves to starve." 
"Quite so," 1? Bilbo. "I I, 1. point of view. At 19 same (a winter is coming on

"We have, a -" (a ago; H^ 3 has he . to do !" us?" asked 19 king.

"Why do 11 tell us this? Are 11 betraying 1. friends, or 62 11 threatening us?" 
asked Bard grimly. 
"My dear Bard!" squeaked Bilbo. "Don't be so hasty! I never met such suspicious folk! I 
am merely trying to avoid trouble hi 10 concerned. Now I E make 11 an offer!!" 
"Let us hear it!" 17 said. 
"You may I, it!" 1? he. "It is this!" 18 he drew forth 19 Arkenstone, 18 threw away 
19 wrapping. 
), Elvenking himself, whose eyes 13 used to things of wonder 18 beauty, stood up 
in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It -1 as if a globe 16 2

"This is 19 Arkenstone of Thrain," 1? Bilbo, "the Heart of 19 Mountain; 18 it is also 
19 heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you. It E aid 11 in 
1. bargaining." Then Bilbo, 12 without a shudder, 12 without a glance of longing, 
handed 19 marvelous stone to Bard, 18 he held it in 14 hand, as though dazed. 
"But how is it yours to give?" he asked at O! !" an effort. 
good well!" 1? 19 hobbit uncomfortably. "It isn't exactly; but, well, I am willing to let it 
stand against 10 my claim, don't 11 know. I may be a burglar-or so 17 say: personally 
I never really felt 4 one-but I am an honest one, I hope, & or less. Anyway I am 
going ye now, 18 19 s can do 3 17 4 to me. I hope 11 E find it 
useful." 
), Elvenking looked at II !" a new wonder. 
"Bilbo Baggins!" he said. "You 62 & worthy to wear 19 armour of elfprinces Or 
many 15 ." looked & comely in it. (I I wonder if Up Oakenshield E I, it 
so. I ." & knowledge of s in general Or 11 ." perhaps. I advise 11 to

"Thank 11 5 much I am sure," 1? II !" a bow. "But I don't think I ought to 
leave my friends 4 this, Is 10 we ." gone through together. And I promised to 
wake old Bombur at midnight, too! Really I must be going, 18 quickly." 
Nothing 17 -a say ' stop him; so an escort -1 provided hi him, 18 as he 
"a both 19 king 18 Bard saluted -- !" honour. As 17 passed through 19 camp 
an old man wrapped in a dark cloak, rose a. a tent door where he -1 sitting 18 
1 towards them. 
"Well done! Mr. Baggins!" he said, clapping II on 19 back. "There is always & 
o' 11 Or anyone expects!" It -1 Gandalf. 
For 19 first (a hi many a day II -1 really delighted. (I Lo -1 no (a hi 10

clambered up 19 rope again - it -1 ! where he 16 left it. He untied it 18 hid it, 18 
then he sat 32 on 19 wall 18 wondered anxiously 3 ' happen next. 
At midnight he woke up Bombur; 18 then in turn rolled himself up in 14 corner, without

along 19 narrow path. At a distance he stood 18 hailed them, asking whether Up

"That E be Dain!" 1? Up 7 he heard. "They E ." . wind of 14 coming. I

"We 62 12 thieves," Bard answered. "Your own we E give ye in return hi our own." 
'How 1 11 by it?" shouted Up in gathering rage. 
"I gave it them!" squeaked Bilbo, who -1 peeping " 19 wall, by now, in a dreadful

"You! You!" cried Thorin, turning upon -- 18 grasping -- !" both hands. "You

"By 19 beard of Durin! I wish I 16 Gandalf here! Curse -- hi 14 choice of you! May

packs on er backs in addition to er weapons. 6 ' stand a siege hi weeks, 
18 by 15 (a yet & s might come, 18 yet more, hi Up 16 many 
relatives. Also 17 ' be able to reopen 18 guard B other gate, so 15 19 
besiegers ' ." to encircle 19 whole mountain; 18 hi 15 17 16 12 sufficient 
numbers. 
These were, in fact, precisely er plans (for 19 raven-messengers 16 2 busy 
between Up 18 Dain); H^ hi 19 moment 19 way -1 barred, so Is angry words 
19 dwarf-messengers retired muttering in er beards. Bard then sent messengers at 
once to 19 Gate; H^ 17 found no gold or payment. 
Arrows 1 forth as soon as 17 13 within shot, 18 17 hastened ye in dismay. 
In 19 camp 10 -1 m astir, as if hi battle; hi 19 s of Dain 13 advancing 
along 19 eastern bank. 
"Fools!" laughed Bard, "to H thus beneath 19 Mountain's arm! 6 do 12 
understand war above ground, whatever 17 may know of battle in 19 mines. : 62 
many of our archers 18 spearmen m hidden in 19 rocks upon er right flank. Dwarfmail may be good, H^ 17 E soon be hard put to it. Let us set on Bp m a. both 
sides, My 17 62 fully rested!" 
(I 19 Elvenking said: "Long E I tarry, ere I begin et war hi gold. ), s 
cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything 15 we cannot mark. Let us hope ! hi 
something 15 E bring reconciliation. 
Our advantage in numbers E be enough, if in 19 end it must H to unhappy blows." 
(I he reckoned without 19 dwarves. ), knowledge 15 19 Arkenstone -1 in 19 
hands of 19 besiegers burned in er thoughts; also 17 guessed 19 hesitation of Bard 
18 14 friends, 18 resolved to strike while 17 debated. 
Suddenly without a signal 17 sprang silently forward to attack. Bows twanged 18 
arrows whistled; battle -1 o' to be joined. 
Still & suddenly a darkness 1 on !" dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried 
" 19 sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up 18 rumbled in 19 
Mountain, 18 lightning lit its peak. And beneath 19 thunder another blackness -a be 
seen whirling forward; H^ it 9 12 H !" 19 wind, it 1 a. 19 North, 4 a 
vast cloud of birds, so dense 15 no light -a be seen between er wings. 
"Halt!" cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, 18 stood alone, !" arms uplifted, 
between 19 advancing s 18 19 ranks awaiting them. "Halt!" he called in a voice 
4 thunder, 18 14 staff blazed forth !" a flash 4 19 lightning. "Dread has H 
upon 11 all! Alas! it has H & swiftly Or I guessed. ), Goblins 62 upon you! 
Bolg of 19 North is coming. 
O Dain! whose father 11 slew in Moria. Behold! 19 bats 62 above 14 army 4 a sea 
of locusts. 6 ride upon wolves 18 Wargs 62 in er train!" 
Amazement 18 confusion fell upon Bp all. Even as Gandalf 16 2 speaking 19 
darkness grew. ), s halted 18 gazed at 19 sky. ), elves cried An !" many 
voices. 
"Come!" called Gandalf. "There is yet (a hi council. Let Dain son of Nain H swiftly 
to us!" 
So began a battle 15 none 16 expected; 18 it -1 called 19 Battle of Five Armies, 
18 it -1 5 terrible. Upon ; side 13 19 Goblins 18 19 wild Wolves, 18 upon 
19 other 13 Elves 18 Men 18 Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since 19 fall of 
19 Great Goblin of 19 Misty Mountains 19 hatred of er race hi 19 s 16 
2 rekindled to fury. Messengers 16 passed to 18 fro between 10 er cities, 
colonies 18 strongholds; hi 17 resolved m to win 19 dominion of 19 North. 
Tidings 17 16 gathered in secret ways; 18 in 10 19 mountains Lo -1 a forging 
18 an arming. 
Then 17 marched 18 gathered by hill 18 valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, 
until around 18 beneath 19 T mountain Gundabad of 19 North, where -1 er 
capital, a vast host -1 assembled ready to sweep 32 in (a of storm unawares 
upon 19 South. Then 17 learned of 19 death of Smaug, 18 joy -1 in er hearts: 
18 17 hastened night Is night through 19 mountains, 18 1 thus at O! on a 
sudden a. 19 North hard on 19 heels of Dain. Not Of 19 ravens knew of er 
coming until 17 1 An in 19 broken lands Be divided 19 Lonely Mountain a. 
19 hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be said, H^ it is plain 15 he 16 12 
expected et sudden assault. 
This is 19 plan 15 he made in council !" 19 Elvenking 18 !" Bard; 18 !" Dain, 
hi 19 dwarf-lord m joined them: 19 Goblins 13 19 foes of all, 18 at er coming 
10 other quarrels 13 forgotten. Their Go hope -1 to lure 19 goblins 8 19 valley 
between 19 arms of 19 Mountain; 18 themselves to man 19 T spurs 15 struck 
south 18 east. Yet et ' be perilous, if 19 goblins 13 in sufficient numbers to 
overrun 19 Mountain itself, 18 so attack Bp also a. behind 18 above; H^ Lo 
-1 no (a hi make Ya other plan, or to summon Ya help. 
Soon 19 thunder passed, rolling away to 19 South-East; H^ 19 batcloud came, flying 
lower, " 19 shoulder of 19 Mountain, 18 whirled above Bp shutting An 19 light 
18 filling Bp !" dread. 
"To 19 Mountain!" called Bard. "To 19 Mountain! Let us take our places while Lo is 
yet time!" 
On 19 Southern spur, in its lower slopes 18 in 19 rocks at its feet, 19 Elves 13 set; 
on 19 Eastern spur 13 men 18 dwarves. (I Bard 18 B of 19 nimblest of men 
18 elves climbed to 19 height of 19 Eastern shoulder to gain a view to 19 North. Soon 
17 -a I, 19 lands My 19 Mountain's feet black !" a hurrying multitude. Ere 
-" 19 vanguard swirled round 19 spur's end 18 1 rushing 8 Dale. These 13 
19 swiftest wolfriders, 18 already er cries 18 howls rent 19 air afar. A few brave 
men 13 strung My Bp to make a feint of resistance, 18 many Lo fell My 
19 rest drew ye 18 fled to either side. As Gandalf 16 hoped, 19 goblin army 16 
gathered behind 19 resisted vanguard, 18 poured m in rage 8 19 valley, driving 
wildly up between 19 arms of 19 Mountain, seeking hi 19 foe. Their banners 13 
countless, black 18 red, 18 17 1 on 4 a tide in fury 18 disorder. 
It -1 a terrible battle. ), most dreadful of 10 Bilbo's experiences, 18 19 ; Be at 
19 (a he hated most - Be is to say it -1 19 ; he -1 most proud of, 18 most 
fond of recalling -" afterwards, although he -1 quite unimportant in it. Actually I must 
say he put on 14 ring early in 19 business, 18 vanished a. sight, if 12 a. 10 
danger. A magic ring of 15 sort is 12 a complete protection in a goblin charge, nor 
does it stop flying arrows 18 wild spears; H^ it does help in getting An of 19 way, 18 
it prevents 1. head a. being specially chosen hi a sweeping stroke by a goblin 
swordsman. 
), elves 13 19 first to charge. Their hatred hi 19 goblins is cold 18 bitter. Their 
spears 18 swords shone in 19 gloom !" a gleam of chill flame, so deadly -1 19 
wrath of 19 hands 15 held them. As soon as 19 host of er enemies -1 dense in 
19 valley, 17 sent against it a shower of arrows, 18 each flickered as it fled as if !" 
stinging fire. Behind 19 arrows a thousand of er spearmen leapt 32 18 charged. 
), yells 13 deafening. ), rocks 13 stained black !" goblin blood. Just as 19 
goblins 13 recovering a. 19 onslaught 18 19 elf-charge -1 halted, Lo rosen 
a. across 19 valley a deep-throated roar. With cries of "Moria!" 18 "Dain, Dain!" 19 
s of 19 Iron Hills plunged in, wielding er mattocks, upon 19 other side; 18 
beside Bp 1 19 men of 19 Lake !" -" swords. 
Panic 1 upon 19 Goblins; 18 Of as 17 turned to meet et new attack, 19 
elves charged again !" renewed numbers. Already many of 19 goblins 13 flying 
ye 32 19 river to escape a. 19 trap: 18 many of er own wolves 13 turning 
upon Bp 18 rending 19 dead 18 19 wounded. Victory seemed at hand, 7 a cry 
rang An on 19 heights above. 
Goblins 16 scaled 19 Mountain a. 19 other side 18 already many 13 on 19 
slopes above 19 Gate, 18 others 13 streaming 32 recklessly, heedless of those 
15 fell screaming a. cliff 18 precipice, to attack 19 spurs a. above. Each of these 
-a be reached by paths 15 ran 32 a. 19 main mass of 19 Mountain in 19 
centre; 18 19 defenders 16 too few to bar 19 way hi long. Victory m vanished 
a. hope. 6 16 Go stemmed 19 first onslaught of 19 black tide. 
Day drew on. ), goblins gathered again in 19 valley. : a host of Wargs 1 
ravening 18 !" Bp 1 19 bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size !" scimitars 
of steel. Soon actual darkness -1 coming 8 a stormy sky; while ! 19 T bats 
swirled o' 19 heads 18 ears of elves 18 men, or fastened vampire-like on 19 
stricken. Now Bard -1 fighting to defend 19 Eastern spur, 18 yet giving slowly back; 
18 19 elf-lords 13 at bay o' er king upon 19 southern arm, near to 19 watchpost on Ravenhill. 
Suddenly Lo -1 a T shout, 18 a. 19 Gate 1 a trumpet call. 
6 16 forgotten Thorin! Part of 19 wall, moved by levers, fell outward !" a crash 
8 19 pool. Out leapt 19 King under 19 Mountain, 18 14 companions followed him. 
Hood 18 cloak 13 gone; 17 13 in shining armour, 18 red light leapt a. er 
eyes. In 19 gloom 19 T dwarf gleamed 4 gold in a dying fire. 
Rocks 13 buried 32 a. on high by 19 goblins above; H^ 17 held on leapt 32 
to 19 falls' foot, 18 rushed forward to battle. Wolf 18 rider fell or fled My them. 
Up wielded 14 axe !" mighty strokes, 18 nothing seemed to harm him. 
"To me! To me! Elves 18 Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!" he cried, 18 14 voice shook 
4 a horn in 19 valley. 
Down, heedless of order, rushed 10 19 s of Dain to 14 help. Down too 1 
many of 19 Lake-men, hi Bard -a 12 restrain them; 18 An upon 19 other side 
1 many of 19 spearmen of 19 elves. Once again 19 goblins 13 stricken in 19 
valley; 18 17 13 piled in heaps till Dale -1 dark 18 hideous !" er corpses. 
), Wargs 13 scattered 18 Up drove right against 19 bodyguards of Bolg. (I 
he -a 12 pierce er ranks. 
Already behind -- among 19 goblin dead lay many men 18 many dwarves, 18 many 
a fair elf 15 should ." lived yet -" ages merrily in 19 wood. And as 19 valley 
widened 14 onset grew ever slower. His numbers 13 too few. 
His flanks 13 unguarded. Soon 19 attackers 13 attacked, 18 17 13 forced 8 
a T ring, facing every way, hemmed 10 o' !" goblins 18 wolves returning to 
19 assault. ), bodyguard of Bolg 1 howling against them, 18 drove in upon er 
ranks 4 waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends -a 12 help them, hi 19 assault 
a. 19 Mountain -1 renewed !" redoubled force, 18 upon either side men 18 
elves 13 being slowly beaten down. 
On 10 et II looked !" misery. He 16 taken 14 stand on Ravenhill among 19 
Elves-partly because Lo -1 & chance of escape a. 15 point, 18 partly (with 
19 & Tookish part of 14 mind) because if he -1 going to be in a O! desperate 
stand, he preferred on 19 whole to defend 19 Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, -1 
there, sitting on 19 ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I suppose, B O! blast of 
magic My 19 end. 
That 9 12 seem Oh off. "It E 12 be -" now," thought Bilbo, "before 19 goblins win 
19 Gate, 18 we 62 10 slaughtered or driven 32 18 captured. Really it is enough to 
make ; weep, Is 10 ; has gone through. I ' rather old Smaug 16 2 left 
!" 10 19 wretched treasure, Or 15 these vile creatures should get it, 18 poor old 
Bombur, 18 Balin 18 Fili 18 Kili 18 10 19 rest H to a bad end; 18 Bard too, 18 
19 Lake-men 18 19 merry elves. Misery me! I ." heard songs of many battles, 18 I 
." always understood 15 defeat may be glorious. It seems 5 uncomfortable, 12 
to say distressing. I wish I -1 well An of it." 
), clouds 13 torn by 19 wind, 18 a red sunset slashed 19 West. 
Seeing 19 sudden gleam in 19 gloom II looked round. He gave a T cry: he 16 
seen a sight 15 made 14 heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against 19 distant 
glow. 
"The Eagles! ), Eagles!" he shouted. "The Eagles 62 coming!" 
Bilbo's eyes 13 seldom wrong. ), eagles 13 coming 32 19 wind, line Is line, 
in such a host as must ." gathered a. 10 19 eyries of 19 North. 
"The Eagles! 19 Eagles!" II cried, dancing 18 waving 14 arms. If 19 elves -a 
12 I, -- 17 -a hear him. Soon 17 too took up 19 cry, 18 it echoed across 19 
valley. Many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet nothing -a be seen except 
a. 19 southern shoulders of 19 Mountain. 
"The Eagles!" cried II once more, H^ at 15 moment a stone hurtling a. above 
smote heavily on 14 helm, 18 he fell !" a crash 18 knew no more. 
Chapter and 
), Return Journey 
When II 1 to himself, he -1 literally by himself. He -1 lying on 19 flat stones 
of Ravenhill, 18 no ; -1 near. A cloudless day, H^ cold, -1 broad above him. He 
-1 shaking, 18 as chilled as stone, H^ 14 head burned !" fire. 
"Now I wonder 3 has happened?" he 1? to himself. "At Ya rate I am 12 yet ; of 
19 fallen heroes; H^ I suppose Lo is ! (a enough hi that!" 
He sat up painfully. Looking 8 19 valley he -a I, no living goblins. After a while 
as 14 head cleared a little, he thought he -a I, elves moving in 19 rocks below. He 
rubbed 14 eyes. Surely Lo -1 a camp ! in 19 plain B distance off; 18 Lo 
-1 a coming 18 going o' 19 Gate? Dwarves seemed to be busy removing 19 
wall. (I 10 -1 deadly still. : -1 no call 18 no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed 
to be in 19 air. "Victory Is all, I suppose!" he said, feeling 14 aching head. "Well, 
it seems a 5 gloomy business." 
Suddenly he -1 aware of a man climbing up 18 coming towards him. 
"Hullo there!" he called !" a shaky voice. "Hullo there! What news?" 
"What voice is it 15 speaks among 19 stones?" 1? 19 man halting 18 peering o' 
-- 12 Oh a. where II sat. 
Then II remembered 14 ring! "Well I'm blessed!" 1? he. "This invisibility has its 
drawbacks Is all. Otherwise I suppose I might ." spent a warm 18 comfortable 
night in bed!" 
"It's me, II Baggins, companion of Thorin!" he cried, hurriedly taking 
off 19 ring. 
"It is well 15 I ." found you!" 1? 19 man striding forward. "You 62 needed 18 we 
." looked hi 11 long. You ' ." 2 numbered among 19 dead, who 62

." 2 sent to look here hi 19 O! time. Are 11 much hurt?" 
"A nasty knock on 19 head, I think," 1? Bilbo. "But I ." a helm 18 a hard skull. All 
19 same I feel sick 18 my legs 62 4 straws." 
"I E carry 11 32 to 19 camp in 19 valley," 1? 19 man, 18 picked -- lightly up. 
), man -1 swift 18 sure-footed. It -1 12 -" My II -1 set 32 My a 
tent in Dale; 18 Lo stood Gandalf, !" 14 arm in a sling. 
Even 19 wizard 16 12 escaped without a wound; 18 Lo 13 few unharmed in 10 
19 host. 
When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he -1 delighted. "Baggins!" he exclaimed. "Well I never! Alive 
Is 10 - came am glad! I began to wonder if Of 1. luck ' I, 11 through! A 
terrible business, 18 it nearly -1 disastrous. (I other news can wait. Come!" he 1? 
& gravely. "You 62 called for;" 18 leading 19 hobbit he took -- within 19 tent. 
"Hail! Thorin," he 1? as he entered. "I ." brought him." 
: indeed lay Up Oakenshield, wounded !" many wounds, 18 14 rent armour 
18 notched axe 13 cast upon 19 floor. He looked up as II 1 beside him. 
"Farewell, "O thief," he said. "I go m to 19 halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, 
until 19 world is renewed. Since I leave m 10 gold 18 silver, 18 go where it is of Do 
worth, I wish to part in friendship a. you, 18 I ' take ye my words 18 deeds 
at 19 Gate." 
II knelt on ; knee filled !" sorrow. "Farewell, King under 19 Mountain!" he said. 
"This is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; 18 12 a mountain of gold can amend it. 
Yet I am glad 15 I ." shared in 1. perils - 15 has 2 & Or Ya Baggins 
deserves." 
"No!" 1? Thorin. "There is & in 11 of "O Or 11 know, child of 19 kindly West. 
Some courage 18 B wisdom, blended in measure. If & of us valued food 18 
cheer 18 song above hoarded gold, it ' be a merrier world. (I sad or merry, I 
must leave it now. Farewell!" 
Then II turned away, 18 he "a by himself, 18 sat alone wrapped in a blanket, 
and, whether 11 believe it or not, he wept until 14 eyes 13 red 18 14 voice -1 
hoarse. He -1 a kindly Do soul. Indeed it -1 -" My he 16 19 heart to make a

All 15 16 happened Is he -1 stunned, II learned later; H^ it gave -- & 
sorrow Or joy, 18 he -1 m weary of 14 adventure. He -1 aching in 14 bones hi 
19 homeward journey. That, however, -1 a Do delayed, so in 19 meantime I E tell 
something of events. ), Eagles 16 -" 16 suspicion of 19 goblins' mustering; a. 
er watchfulness 19 movements in 19 mountains -a 12 be altogether hid. So 17 
too 16 gathered in T numbers, under 19 T Eagle of 19 Misty Mountains; 18 at 
length smelling battle a. afar 17 16 H speeding 32 19 gale in 19 nick of 
time. 6 it -1 who dislodged 19 goblins a. 19 mountainslopes, casting Bp "

-" My 17 16 freed 19 Lonely Mountain, 18 elves 18 men on either side of 19

(I Of !" 19 Eagles 17 13 ! outnumbered. 
In 15 O! hour Beorn himself 16 appeared - no ; knew how or a. where. He 
1 alone, 18 in bear's shape; 18 he seemed to ." grown almost to giant-size in 
14 wrath. ), roar of 14 voice -1 4 drums 18 guns; 18 he tossed wolves 18 
goblins a. 14 path 4 straws 18 feathers. He fell upon er rear, 18 broke 4 a 
clap of thunder through 19 ring. ), s 13 making a stand ! o' er lords 
upon a low rounded hill. 
Then Beorn stooped 18 lifted Thorin, who 16 fallen pierced !" spears, 18 bore -- 
An of 19 fray. Swiftly he returned 18 14 wrath -1 redoubled, so 15 nothing -a 
withstand him, 18 no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered 19 bodyguard, 
18 pulled 32 Bolg himself 18 crushed him. Then dismay fell on 19 Goblins 18 
17 fled in 10 directions. (I weariness left er enemies !" 19 coming of new hope,

parts of 19 goblin warriors of 19 North perished on 15 day, 18 19 mountains 16

II returned to 19 camp; 18 12 many 13 in 19 valley save 19 & grievously 
wounded. 
"Where 62 19 Eagles?" he asked Gandalf 15 evening, as he lay wrapped in many 
warm blankets. 
"Some 62 in 19 hunt," 1? 19 wizard, "but most ." gone ye to er eyries. 6 
' 12 stay here, 18 departed !" 19 first light of morning. Dain has crowned er 
chief !" gold, 18 sworn friendship !" Bp hi ever." 
"I am sorry. I mean, I should ." liked to I, Bp again," 1? II sleepily; "perhaps 
I shall I, Bp on 19 way home. I suppose I shall be going home soon?" 
"As soon as 11 like," 1? 19 wizard. 
Actually it -1 B days My II really set out. 
6 buried Up deep beneath 19 Mountain, 18 Bard laid 19 
Arkenstone upon 14 breast. 
"There let it lie till 19 Mountain falls!" he said. "May it bring "O fortune to 10 14 folk 
15 dwell here after!" Upon 14 tomb 19 Elvenking then laid Orcrist, 19 elvish sword 
15 16 2 taken a. Up in captivity. It is 1? in songs 15 it gleamed ever in 19 
dark if foes approached, 18 19 fortress of 19 s -a 12 be taken by surprise. 
: m Dain son of Nain took up 14 abode, 18 he became King under 19 
Mountain, 18 in (a many other s gathered to 14 throne in 19 ancient halls. even 
19 twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili 18 Kili 16 fallen defending -- 
!" shield 18 body, hi he -1 er mother's elder brother. ), others remained !" 
Dain; hi Dain dealt 14 treasure well. 
: was, of course, no longer Ya question of dividing 19 hoard in such shares as 
16 2 planned, to Balin 18 Dwalin, 18 Dori 18 Nori 18 Ori, 18 Oin 18 Gloin, 
18 Bifur 18 Bofur 18 Bombur-or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of 10 19 silver 18 
gold, wrought 18 unwrought, -1 given up to Bard; hi Dain said: "We E honour 19 
agreement of 19 dead, 18 he has m 19 Arkenstone in 14 keeping." 
Even a fourteenth share -1 wealth exceedingly great, greater Or 15 of many mortal 
kings. From 15 treasure Bard sent much gold to 19 Master of Lake-town; 18 he 
rewarded 14 followers 18 friends freely. To 19 Elvenking he gave 19 emeralds of 
Girion, such jewels as he most loved, Be Dain 16 restored to him. To II he said: 
"This treasure is as much yours as it is mine; though old agreements cannot stand, since 
so many ." a claim in its winning 18 defence. Yet Of though 11 13 willing to 
lay aside 10 1. claim, I should wish 15 19 words of Thorin, of Be he repented, 
should 12 prove true: 15 we should give 11 little. I ' reward 11 most richly of 
all." 
"Very kind of you," 1? Bilbo. "But really it is a relief to me. How on earth should I ." 
. 10 15 treasure home without war 18 murder 10 along 19 way, I don't know. And I 
don't know 3 I should ." done !" it 7 I . home. I am sure it is better in 1. 
hands." 
In 19 end he ' Go take two small chests, ; filled !" silver, 18 19 other !" 
gold, such as ; strong pony -a carry. "That E be quite as much as I can 
manage," 1? he. 
At O! 19 (a 1 hi -- to say good-bye to 14 friends. "Farewell, Balin!" he said; 
"and farewell, Dwalin; 18 farewell Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, 18 Bombur!

Again it -1 evening, er ponies 13 tired, especially 19 ; 15 carried 19
